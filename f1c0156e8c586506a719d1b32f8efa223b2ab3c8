      "message": "Making the WaitRefs tighter makes the ASSERTs happy, but isn\u0027t the real problem still here - that we can end up with two ProcessEvents trying to process the same event? The idea of the WaitRef is to be a safer version of Ref and I think it was succeeding in catching an error here.\n\nThe mutex wrapper of `mEvents` (then `mTrackers-\u003epollEvents`) used to wrap the entire lifetime of the WaitRef, instead of having a separate mProcessEventLock on the inner section. Do you remember why this changed?\nhttps://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/151532/2..4\n\nWaitAny splits the critical section because it independent WaitAny calls are supposed to be able to run in parallel (WaitRef tries to catch bugs, in debug builds). But there\u0027s no such thing as independent ProcessEvents calls since they always wait the same list.",
