Overall we shouldn\u0027t need a pipeline because the bindgroups only need to be referenced in the pass to be validated but don\u0027t need to actually be used. So we can do:\n BeginRenderPass\n SetBindGroup\n EndPass\nAnd that should be sufficient.\n\nL202:\nCould we have similar tests but for a compute pass where the bindgroup is referenced? (no need for a Dispatch call)",
