      "message": "hm, I feel like we must be able to do this without adding skip_serialize.\n\nWe can have a function which says whether a member is serializable or not. I think that the following things are not serializable:\n - function pointers\n - non-value types that are void with `member.length \u003d\u003d \"constant\"`\n \n \nThen we could do something like:\n\n```\n{% set serializable_members \u003d [] %}\n{%- for member in members %}\n  {% if is_serializable(member) %}\n     {{ serializable_members.append(member) }}\n  {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nat the very top of write_record_serialization_helpers, and then mostly use `serializable_members` throughout. That\u0027ll help us keep the transfer struct / serialize / deserialize all in sync with the same set of members.\n\nI also think we would need the code at [1] which skips over already-initialized-to-nullptr members",

      "message": "So to be clear, `skip_serialize` already exists (see https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/dawn_wire.json;l\u003d40). I\u0027m just extending it for this. I\u0027m hesitant to add another concept of serializable on top of that because then it becomes a really overloaded term.\n\nMaybe it will work for the `Serialize` function to do something like that, but IIUC, just cause something is `skip_serialize` it does NOT mean it skips being `Deserialize`d. I think maybe a better way is to define the two cases more explicitly? WDYT?",
