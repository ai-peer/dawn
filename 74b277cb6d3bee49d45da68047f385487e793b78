      "message": "Dawn\u0027s interface probably does everything in utf-8, which means results should probably be in utf-8 code units (i.e. bytes). In chromium however we need utf-16 code units. In order to remap this you basically need to go from utf-8 code units -\u003e unicode code points -\u003e utf-16 code units. This isn\u0027t hard, just take the utf-8 string, iterate over code points adding 1 each time, adding 2 instead if the code point takes 2 utf-16 code units. But it does require having the string, so if done in chromium would require holding onto the string there.\n\nanyway, probably no change here, just something to think about.",
