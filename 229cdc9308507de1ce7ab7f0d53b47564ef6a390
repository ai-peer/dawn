      "message": "A tiny change, PTAL. Recently I am ramping up WebGPU CTS and looking into bind group and bind group layout related tests to learn the code. I didn\u0027t find such a test in cts, I didn\u0027t find any statement about this in spec, and I didn\u0027t find any validation code about this in Dawn: binding index \u003e\u003d kMaxBindingsPerGroup is invalid. \n\nThe error reported is actually triggered by binding index mismatch between bindGroup and bindGroupLayout. If we set the binding index to kMaxBindingsPerGroup in BGL, it can pass (see patch set 1).",

      "message": "Right now, Dawn has a lot of static sized arrays which rely on kMaxBindingsPerGroup.\n\nI think the intent of the test is that using a value this large doesn\u0027t overflow and result in passing validation because (kMaxBindingsPerGroup % kMaxBindingsPerGroup \u003d\u003d 0)\n\nSo for now, I think we should keep it. I\u0027ll be removing kMaxBindingsPerGroup soon though",

      "message": "Hey Austin, thanks for your quick reply. But I may have different opinions about this:\n1) If the total binding number exceeds kMaxBindingsPerGroup, the validation code can catch that. And we do have tests to cover that. So don\u0027t worry. it is safe. And you can proceed your kMaxBindingsPerGroup work whenever you have time. See [1].\n2) Regarding the binding index itself, we do have the test for bind group layout which says that binding \u003e\u003d kMaxBindingsPerGroup is OK. see [2].\n3) As I said, this test fail because the binding number mismatch. It is not triggered by what the comment said at all (and the comment itself is incorrect). And we have already have test for binding number mismatch between bind group and bind group layout, see [3].",
