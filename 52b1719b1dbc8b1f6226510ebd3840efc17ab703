Don\u0027t need to specify the RenderTarget values.\n\n\nI would expect SampleTypeBit probably to be Float/UnfilterableFloat. Which one depends on the properties from the AHardwareBuffer though.\n\n\nI\u0027m wondering if it would be better to not put External in the format table at all.\nInstead.. we do something like store a `Format` in the SharedTextureMemoryContents (texture refs STMContents), and then have TextureBase::mFormat refer to that format.\n\nthis might make more sense because I imagine different external formats will have different capabilities. Doing this though, you might need to update a bunch of replace to take a pair of (wgpu::TextureFormat, dawn::native::Format) - that way you have the format information available if it was external. You\u0027ll no longer be able to look up the format information from the External enum",

      "message": "The not being able to lookup format information sounds tricky. I know that we do want to expose the format to Chromium so that it can be set and passed down to Skia. Would that be impacted? Not sure if Skia also needs to know. We also probably want to use it in Chromium for format conversions etc.\n\nDid you mean SharedResourceMemoryContents? I\u0027m also unsure how much work replace would involve. I\u0027d personally prefer format here as I\u0027m more familiarized with the flow with such formats than them being internal, and the nuances of how they can/cannot be used so would need more understanding.\n\nMaybe renaming it to `ExternalAndroid` or `ExternalAndroidVk` would make it more clear that this is only for Android?",

      "message": "at a high level, the wgpu::TextureFormat is an enum from which we get the `Format` struct (right now). And the Format struct tells you what the format can do based on device-level capabilities.\n\nThe problem is that you can\u0027t map wgpu::TextureFormat::External to a Format struct in this table because the capabilities depend on what actually that external format is.

This matches what Colin says above:\n\u003e my understanding is that it\u0027s legal to use YCbCr sampling for any AHB - it\u0027s just that if the Vk format of the AHB is UNDEFINED it\u0027s necessary to use YCbCr sampling. So it\u0027s totally legal for the client to do YCbCr sampling on an RGBA AHB. I think that this is the case that Saif is setting up for the test, and it\u0027s not actually a test-only situation\n\nbut then that\u0027s inconsistent with what Colin says more recently\n\u003e Would that then mean that we\u0027d allow clients to do YCbCr sampling on a Dawn RGBA texture? I had been under the naive assumption that YCbCr sampling would be restricted to Dawn textures of type External\n\nIMO we should expose what is legal according to Vulkan. Ycbcr can be used for an AHB if its RGB if you would like to. And if the format is External, then you _must_ use Ycbcr.",
