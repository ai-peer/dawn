      "message": "Sorry, we can\u0027t do that. The problem is that the memberBuffer is still accessible by that renderer process and could be modified concurrently with dawn_native looking at it. For example dawn_native could validate an enum, then the renderer process change the enum value, then dawn_native uses the enum. Prevention of TOCTOU attacks is an important feature of the wire and is done by making every single value returned to dawn_native a thing that\u0027s a copy of what\u0027s in the wire.\n\nFor WriteBuffer since it is data-only that\u0027s not security sensitive we could carve out an exception, but the optimization cannot be for all members.",
