      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is the correct approach: there are only a couple places where size_t is used in the wire commands: QueueWriteBuffer/Texture (which could become u32 and fail in the client if that\u0027s not the case) and BufferMapAsync that could be using u64 with the narrowing check done in the handler/doer. It would make size a bunch simpler and would allow blamket disallowing size_t in WireCmd.cpp by #define size_t dontUseSizeTInThisFile.",
