(This is the case that I previously thought was a render pass re-using a previous render passes attachments. I wasn\u0027t aware that Dawn was injecting a compute pass at the time.)\n\nSo while this is possibly a little overly broad, it\u0027s the only thing I\u0027ve found that covers all of the instances of this crash that I\u0027ve encountered.",
