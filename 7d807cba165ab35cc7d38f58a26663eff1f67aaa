The rule I had in mind for these is that each method validates \u0027shallowly\u0027 - i.e. the method validates the AST node, but no children (as these should already be resolved, then validated), and no parents (as these are yet to be resolved). Might also be worth mentioning that these methods assume that the node has been resolved before being called.",
