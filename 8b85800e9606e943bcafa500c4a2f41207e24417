      "message": "In addition to maxVertexAttribute-related changes, this is one of the more non-trivial limit-related changes because this change has a non-trivial impact on Dawn\u0027s runtime memory footprint. I\u0027d recommend reviewing this by checking out the CL and looking for remaining usages of \"kMaxBindGroups\".\n\nI\u0027ve set it *very* tentatively to 32 because according to vulkan.gpuinfo.org, apparently there are thousands of reports that can support this. That said, 32 bind groups is a LOT and I think it would be reasonable to leave it at 16 or even 8. I think Dawn might prefer to expose fewer bind groups so that we can use the remaining binding space to ex.) support more dynamic buffers or something else.",
