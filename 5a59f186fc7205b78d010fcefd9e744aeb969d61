      "message": "PTAL!\n\nOne minor implementation note: The spec says that the BGL should have a reference to the pipeline it was created with and use that for the compatibility check, but when implementing this I realized that we don\u0027t actually create the pipeline object until after the \"default\" layout has been created. As a result, I\u0027m using a simple \"compatibilityGroupId\" to track which bind groups are compatible with one another. Since this is never exposed the the user, it has the same effect as the spec text. ",
