      "message": "We\u0027re currently avoiding statically loading (or linking) spirv_to_dxil.dll since Mesa uses a different build system to Dawn (it uses meson) and it is non-trivial to convert it into a GN/CMake build.\n\nThis change does not include spirv_to_dxil and is a work-in-progress pending a decision on how this should be done.\n- We can ship the DLL as a binary blob with Dawn\u0027s source, although I know shipping binary blobs gets icky in many ways\n- We can let users build the DLL separately and make it entirely optional, although without CI testing this has a potential for regressions.\n- Some other option?\n\nThanks again!",
