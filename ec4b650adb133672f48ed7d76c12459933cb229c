      "message": "Please keep a comment here saying that we are explicitly *not* handling the fallthrough case because of a WGSL limitation.\n\nThis set of enums matches cases enumerated in https://registry.khronos.org/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#_rules_for_structured_control_flow_constructs \n\nIt would be weird and appear to be buggy if we missed a case that was described there.\n\nIn fact my nit-level preference is to keep the enum, deduce it, and then immediately bail when we detect it being used.",
