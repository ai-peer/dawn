      "message": "According to the spec for VertexInputDescriptor: https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/blob/master/spec/index.bs, some members of vertex buffers can be NULL, but the pointer of all vertex buffers (\"buffers\" here) can\u0027t be nullptr. And we use \"const*\" for buffers, which means its elements are structs, not pointers to structs (which require \"const *const*\" for the annotation). So we can\u0027t set nullptr for the particular elements in buffers when it\u0027s NULL. \n\nWe do have tests for this situation in VertexInputTest.cpp in end2end tests. I added a couple of TODOs. One solution is that we construct vertex buffer objects, but set their numAttributes to 0, in order to implicitly indicate that these vertex buffers are NULL.\n\nWDYT?",
