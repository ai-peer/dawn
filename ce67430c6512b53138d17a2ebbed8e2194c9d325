Wondering if:\n- it actually wants a constructor/destructor now that the type is constexpr-constructible\n- it would want a constructor/destructor if Format was an aggregate type (I\u0027m not exactly sure whether it is now or not)\n- it would consider `\u003d default` OK if the constructor were constexpr",
