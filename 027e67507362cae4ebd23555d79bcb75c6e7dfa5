      "message": "This is unsafe because parts of Dawn might be modifying the buffers while we are clearing it. I suggest either making the output happens only at the very end of the perf tests when Dawn should already be completely stopped, or adding a mutex to go along each vector (little contention so that is ok hopefully), and in this loop doing an std::move so that we hold the mutex as little as possible.",
