      "message": "This change adds a new MultiPlanarRenderTargets feature which will add the RenderAttachment usage support. I tried using the MultiPlanarFormatsExtendedUsages feature instead directly here but that would mean first adding support for metal backend there for allowing VideoViewsExtendedUsagesTests::CreateMultiPlanarTexture() which didn\u0027t seem straight-forward; so decided to add this feature instead which added support for metal here and will add other platform support in follow-ups.\n\nPlease take a look.",
