      "message": "I feel like we shouldn\u0027t duplicate the token based shared handle deduplication (pun unintended) logic from Chromium in Dawn. We want to get rid of that in Chromium once we migrate the camera process from using GMBs to using SharedImageInterface.\n\nThe basic aim is to prevent having multiple ExternalImageDXGIs for the same keyed mutex backed texture. The way to do that in Chromium is to cache state in DXGISharedHandleManager which uses a unique token as a key. In addition, we have a map of WGPUDevice to DawnExternalImageState (which contains ExternalImageDXGI) in the D3DImageBacking.\n\nIIUC we could move that map i.e. the dawn_external_image_cache_ that lives in D3DImageBacking currently to DXGISharedHandleState and as a result we\u0027ll get the intended behavior for free.",
