      "message": "Took me a while to think through and understand why this was needed, and IIUC, it\u0027s for the cases where we successfully got to initialization step, but then a device loss occurs so we fail initialization, but because it was a device loss we want to effectively mask the validation error and return a placeholder error pipeline instead. (Would probably be helpful to document something along those lines here since I don\u0027t think it is immediately obvious.)\n\nThat said, I don\u0027t see why we need 2 versions and can\u0027t just pass the label additionally to the `ResultOrError` version. It is also possible that a device loss happens right after we successfully initialized a pipeline in which case we could also return a placeholder error?",

Also, based on the comments in the success case, I think it\u0027s going to be largely removed soon because the cache is thread-safe now.\n\n\u003e It is also possible that a device loss happens right after we successfully initialized a pipeline in which case we could also return a placeholder error?\n\nwe could, but we already have a pipeline; why make a new one?",
