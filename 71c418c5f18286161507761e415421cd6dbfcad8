      "message": "Hey Austin and Corentin,\n\nThis is a sketch of Dawn-side compat mode as built on top of the new AdapterBase wrapper. An enum defines the two versions (compat and full-fat). AdapterBase takes a version on construction and stores it. Each PhysicalDevice reports whether it supports a given version (OpenGL only supports compat; all others support both). For each PhysicalDevice returned by the backend, InstanceBase queries which versions it supports, and creates AdapterBases for each supported version. RequestAdapterOptions contains a bool whether we want compat mode, in which case only Adapter[Bases] of the Compat version are returned.\n\nConsider this a starting point for discussion. ðŸ˜Š",
