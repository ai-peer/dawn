      "message": "Hey Austin and Corentin,\n\nThis is a sketch of Dawn-side compat mode as built on top of the new AdapterBase wrapper. An enum defines the two versions (compat and full-fat). AdapterBase takes a version on construction and stores it. Each PhysicalDevice reports whether it supports a given version (OpenGL only supports compat; all others support both). For each PhysicalDevice returned by the backend, InstanceBase queries which versions it supports, and creates AdapterBases for each supported version. RequestAdapterOptions contains a bool whether we want compat mode, in which case only Adapter[Bases] of the Compat version are returned.\n\nConsider this a starting point for discussion. ðŸ˜Š",

      "message": "Thanks guys. \"WebGPU\" removed, and renamed FeatureLevel.\n\nI like Core; renamed k1_0 -\u003e Core. (We might need to reconsider this for future hardware which might need a k2_0, but this is only internal so we can burn that bridge when we get to it.)\n\nAs to what\u0027s exposed in JS, on the Chrome side I\u0027m currently exposing a compatibilityMode bool. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4209473. Undoubtedly we\u0027ll need to discuss that in the group, but having a feature level there might be contentious. Anyway we can discuss that before we go to the group. It likely won\u0027t be 1:1 with what\u0027s in dawn.js anyway, since I doubt WebGPU will support gles20 or gles30.",
