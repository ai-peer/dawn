Can you remove the class completely and move the two lines of code that are inside this function and put them at [1] please?\n\nSimilar thing for FenceSignalTracker.",

      "message": "[2] Thanks for the comment, it helps a lot understand the thought process and figure out what\u0027s happening.\n\nI don\u0027t think this is correct: what we\u0027re trying to do is make sure all previous work on the queue completed, for example a WriteBuffer call. FutureCallbackSerial isn\u0027t telling us if there is pending work on the queue, but instead tells us the largest serial that has a callback waiting for it. It\u0027s two different things.\n\nFor simplicity I think we should just use GetPendingCommandSerial() and add a TODO to use GetLastSubmittedCommandSerial in the future for performance (it isn\u0027t a correctness issue).",
