It seems loadTransformMatrix \u003d Scale(coordTransformMatrix, mVisibleSize)?\n\nThis this would have the translation of xOffset/yOffset, then we can transform the clamp into a min() that\u0027s done before the transformation. We first clamp to the visible size, then perform the transform that will add the offset.",
