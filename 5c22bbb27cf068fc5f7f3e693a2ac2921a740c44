      "message": "Would be nice to test both, especially since WebGPU will probably only exercise one path (or at least that\u0027s how the spec is today). Don\u0027t have a good way to parameterize now though. Maybe next sprint I\u0027ll port the DawnPerfTest parameterization to DawnTest as well. Overall, I think we should have _some_ combinatorial test support for Dawn, and not just rely on WebGPU.",
