I might prefer to handle this slightly differently: instead of calling ReadyHook and SetReady multiple times, just set ready once without a MapAsyncStatus, then compute the MapAsyncStatus in CompleteImpl. I think we have enough information there to do that. It might also have the bonus effect of making CompleteImpl look more like the WebGPU spec.\n\nWe would still need to SetFutureReady multiple times, but now idempotently (EnsureFutureReady). This could guard ReadyHook and SetReady from being called more than once. This is probably incompatible with how we\u0027re already using SetFutureReady elsewhere, though, so if we want to try to change this, it\u0027ll be a follow-up.",
