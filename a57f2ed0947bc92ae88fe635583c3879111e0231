This Cl update the `MatrixVectorMultiply` perf test to use new features.\n\nThis CL also change the `DawnTest` and `ValidationTest` infra to handle the deprecation warnings emitted by creating devices during `SetUp`, e.g. when creating device with deprecated `chromium-experimental-subgroups` feature required.",
