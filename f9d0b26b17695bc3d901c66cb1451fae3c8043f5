      "message": "Austin, I\u0027m not going to be able to finish this CL before quite some time. There are two issues leftover:\n\n - A VVL failure, likely due to UtilsVulkan.cpp\u0027s VulkanAspectMask choosing pure stencil for stencil8 textures when they are falling back to depth*-stencil8.\n - A d3d12 debug layer issue where it wants 4 bytes per texel for stencil copies with buffers, when AFAIK it should just be 1 byte. (we should check with Rafael, Jesse Natalie).\n \nCan you make sure it finds an owner to take over it?",
