Seems like overkill.\n\nCould this be:\n\nconstexpr size_t arglen \u003d sizeof(kExclusiveDevicePreferenceArg) - 1; (or strlen if you must)\nif (strncmp(argv[i], kExclusiveDeviceTypePreferenceArg, arglen) \u003d\u003d 0)\n\ninstead? Then you could reuse arglen below.",

      "message": "Naming nit: I\u0027m confused by DawnTestParamInit (and DawnTestParam, for that matter).\n\nWhat does it mean, exactly? An initialized DawnTestParam? (no, becuase it\u0027s a base class). The initializer? The \"initial\" form of a DawnTestParam?\n\nMaybe the base could remain DawnTestParam, and the derived could be DawnTestParamWithAdapter?\n\nWhat is DawnTestParam, though? A parameter to a DawnTest? It seems to be the class that is instantiated for each backend (below)? Should it be DawnTestBackend, instead?]",

      "message": "Yea, this probably could have been named better.\n\nSo overall, before this patch, dawn_end2end_tests get parameterized by \"DawnTestParam\" which is the backend type and a list of enabled/disabled backends. It\u0027s a \"Param\" because it\u0027s the param that\u0027s passed to the GoogleTest (::testing::TestWithParam\u003cP\u003e). That way we can run the test for each of: Vulkan, D3D12-with-feature-X, D3D12-without-feature-X, etc.\n\nAfter this patch, the old \"DawnTestParam\" gets transformed into multiple actual \"Params\", one for each adapter matching the backend type. So perhaps I should rename the old struct to \"EnabledBackendForTest\" and the new one to \"AdapterParamForTest\"",
