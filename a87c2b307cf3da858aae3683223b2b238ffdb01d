Seems like overkill.\n\nCould this be:\n\nconstexpr size_t arglen \u003d sizeof(kExclusiveDevicePreferenceArg) - 1; (or strlen if you must)\nif (strncmp(argv[i], kExclusiveDeviceTypePreferenceArg, arglen) \u003d\u003d 0)\n\ninstead? Then you could reuse arglen below.",

(no, becuase it\u0027s a base class). The initializer? The \"initial\" form of a DawnTestParam?\n\nMaybe the base could remain DawnTestParam, and the derived could be DawnTestParamWithAdapter?\n\nWhat is DawnTestParam, though? A parameter to a DawnTest? It seems to be the class that is instantiated for each backend (below)? Should it be DawnTestBackend, instead?]",
