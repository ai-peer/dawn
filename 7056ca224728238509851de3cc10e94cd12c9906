      "message": "Metal is a little bit different here, we can\u0027t return an MTLRenderPipelineColorAttachmentDescriptor. Because its pixelFormat need to be set by other code snippet (see the code on line 176 - 177). Well, we can exchange the sequence between line 178-179 and line 176-177, but the implicit sequence relationship is not good. So I think we should use a pointer and change its values directly in the callee for Metal.",
