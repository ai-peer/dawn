      "message": "Thanks for the feedback! In implementing the deprecation test I decided that it was beneficial to move the VertexFormat utils into their own file, like the TextureFormat utils. It feels a little silly to do that for a usage that will largely disappear when the deprecated formats are removed, but it still feels like a cleaner way to do it. Please take another look at that and the deprecation tests specifically!\n\nAlso, for some reason the deprecation warning was firing twice where I had it previously, so I\u0027ve moved it into the validation code.",
