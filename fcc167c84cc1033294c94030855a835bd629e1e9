      "message": "This is un-defaulting logic in Tint\u0027s CMakeLists.txt that explicitly defaults to using static CRT.\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/tint/src/CMakeLists.txt;l\u003d47-53\n\nThe reason given is:\n\n  # We don\u0027t want to have to copy the C Runtime DLL everywhere the executable\n  # goes.  So by default compile code to assume the CRT is statically linked,\n  # i.e. use /MT* options.  For debug builds use /MTd, and for release builds\n  # use /MT.  If TINT_ENABLE_SHARED_CRT is ON, then use the shared C runtime.\n  # Modify the project-wide options variables. This is ugly, but seems to be\n  # the state of the art.\n\nThis landed in https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/tint/+/20940, which has the rather nondescript CL description:\n\n  Windows fixes.\n\n  This CL fixes up some issues which give compile errors when building\n  with Visual Studio.\n\nMaybe the TINT_ENABLE_SHARED_CRT was just a preference. Maybe there was some build issue.\n\nI don\u0027t really mind what the defaults here are, but it is a bit odd that we\u0027re attempting to disable by-default logic in tint in its outer project. Perhaps we should just be removing this logic from our Tint CMake rules.\n\nApproving as I don\u0027t really mind either way, and Corentin can make the final call.",
