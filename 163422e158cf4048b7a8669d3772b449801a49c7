      "message": "I thought about using Initialize but had second thoughts when I considered that the class has another constructor which doesn\u0027t require Initialize. Would be confusing to new users of the class to know whether calling Initialize is necessary or not. The way I have factored it, calling Create allocates resources and can fail. If you have all of the resources already created ahead of time, use the constructor which can\u0027t fail and doesn\u0027t return an error. It\u0027s an implementation detail that Create calls the constructor.\n\nI\u0027ve never been a fan of two phrase creation because it means you that in the error case, you create something and then immediately delete it again.  Not the end of the world, however.  \n\nWhat do you think?",

In fact, a good RefCounted base class will make the destructor private to the class so that the only way the object gets destroy is by calling Releasee. This prevents code from accidentally deleting the object out from other code which has outstanding references. \n\nI think we should keep the code the way I have it and remove existing places that use unique_ptr for referenced counted objects.\n\nWhat do you think?",
