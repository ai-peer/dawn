Compat mode should be largely a validation thing, and could be running on the Vulkan, D3D12 or Metal backends, for example, which don\u0027t need this workaround.\n\nHowever, taking out this check out would mean this code would run unconditionally for the stencil -\u003e depth-stencil use case. Perhaps we need a new toggle for that?",
