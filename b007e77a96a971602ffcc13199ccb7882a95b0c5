I thought it was previously passing the CQ.\n\nI fixed 2 things:\n### Calling \"python\"\n\nIndeed, on windows you can\u0027t execute the text file directly. You have to call python.\n\nFixed in:\nhttps://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/157860/21..22\n\n### Turning the library from STATIC to INTERFACE\n\nI was getting:\n```\nfatal error LNK1104: cannot open file static lib partition_alloc.lib\n```\nIndeed, there was no \".cc\" files in the library. Within this configuration, this is a header only library. The static library was empty, and nothing was produced on Windows.\n\nI turned the static library into an interface.\n\nFixed in:\nhttps://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/157860/23..24",
