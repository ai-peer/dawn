I think it would be nicer to just omit that helper, and here do:\n\n  dawn::TextureCopyView textureCopyView{texture, 0, 0, {0, 0, 0}, dawn::TextureAspect::Color};\n\n(or {{...}} or \u003d {...} whatever would work).\n\nSame comment everywhere else that uses CreateTextureCopyView, CreateBufferCopyView, and CreateExtent3D.\n\nThis is a bit of work so let\u0027s wait for cwallez\u0027s opinion on this.",
