Is it expected that changing from:\n\n* `#include \u003cdawn/platform/DawnPlatform.h\u003e`\nto\n* `#include \"dawn/platform/DawnPlatform.h\"`\n\nis going to have missing dependencies? (As a note, I tried adding `src/dawn/platform:static` to the `deps` of `dawn_end2end_tests` and that causes link errors with duplicate `Platform` constructor and destructors.)\n\nSo, is this something that should be investigated deeper, or just leave as `\u003c\u003e` as this is expected?\n\n\n```\nERROR at //third_party/dawn/src/dawn/tests/DawnTest.h:32:11: Can\u0027t include this header from here.\n#include \"dawn/platform/DawnPlatform.h\"\n          ^---------------------------\nThe target:\n  //third_party/dawn/src/dawn/tests:dawn_end2end_tests\nis including a file from the target:\n  //third_party/dawn/src/dawn/platform:static\n```",
