These two facts made me think it was an experimental/optional feature and not so important:\n\n1. it\u0027s turned off by default in cmake\n2. third_party/dxc is never fetched by fetch_dawn_depdencies.\n\nWas that an oversight in https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/161420?",

      "message": "DXC is really big, so it\u0027s  better to skip it if desired. Folks using CMake maybe building specific backends (MSL, GLSL, etc) and not care about HLSL. They may also already be using a DXC installed from the system.\n\nChromium, doesn\u0027t use the Cmake build, it uses the GN build and uses gclient to check the dependencies, not `fetch_dawn_dependencies`.\n\nIt\u0027s also used by the `--validate` flag to tint in combination with `--dxc` so we can test the combined HLSL without needing DXC which may not be available.",
