      "message": "The pool probably needs a virtual function to create a WaitableEvent.\n\nThe reason is that the pool implementation may implement the event differently. In our default implementation, it\u0027s currently a std::future. In Chromium, it will use the TaskRunner primitives.\n\nI don\u0027t think we should copy ANGLE too much here since the way their platform interface works is a little bit different. Because we\u0027re using virtual methods, Dawn\u0027s default Platform::CreateWorkerTaskPool() would return ANGLE\u0027s equivalent of AsyncWorkerPool. And Chromium would override this to return ANGLE\u0027s equivalent of DelegateWorkerPool. Dawn wouldn\u0027t have a concept of DelegateWorkerPool.",
