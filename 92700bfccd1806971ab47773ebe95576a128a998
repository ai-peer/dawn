      "message": "@Corentin, you said that we need to assign nullptr to code in CHelloTriangle (https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/3541/4/examples/CubeReflection.cpp). However, when I remove the code, it can pass on bots. And I also tested on my local machines (Windows and Linux), it can draw a triangle without error. I think the code can check nextInChain and it was initialized to nullptr during code autogen for CHelloTriangle. WDYT?\n\nI found your comments before I sent the comment above, Shaobo.\nYes, you might be correct. But it is weird that no error was reported. Do you know why?",

      "message": "The C API doesn\u0027t initialize the pointer so we should keep these assignments in this file and WireTests only. I think it works because this is a simple executable and these variables are the first time a particular stack location is used, which means their values come from a fresh OS page which is zeroed out. Not something we should rely on.",
