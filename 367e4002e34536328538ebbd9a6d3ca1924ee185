      "message": "This CL is a bit of a beast, but I don\u0027t see how to carve it up into pieces because once you add the new variant you need to handle it everywhere in order to get things to build. I put in implementations of the variant handling in the places that seemed straightforward, but many of the places were outside of my domain of expertise - I put TODOs in those. Of course, I might well have gotten some of the ones that I actually filled in wrong as well!\n\nI think that there are tests that I can add to this CL even with just the functionality that\u0027s there now (e.g., of caching), but I\u0027m sending this out for feedback before going further.\n\nThanks!",
