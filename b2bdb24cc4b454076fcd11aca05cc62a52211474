I\u0027m sure there\u0027s something wrong with my commit description--I don\u0027t think I\u0027m supposed to have two Change-Ids (gerrit seems to be using the second Change-Id).\n\nPlease let me know if there\u0027s any preference for how the description should look, like the order of changes listed (i.e. should \"build: Override ...\" go on top instead of \"Roll third_party...\" or vis versa?).\n\nThanks again,\nMichael",
