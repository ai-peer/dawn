      "message": "Apologies if this overlaps with any work already being done. I started making this change as a learning exercise to familiarize myself with Dawn\u0027s code a bit more and didn\u0027t see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/dawn/issues/detail?id\u003d502 till I had gotten to this point.\n\nIf Jiawei has a WIP change that covers the same thing I\u0027m happy to defer to it, otherwise I can see from the issue that I\u0027ll need to make a few changes to match with the discussed migration plan.",

      "message": "Either you doing this change or Jiawei doing it is fine, but please synchronize to make sure there\u0027s no conflict. (Slack can help for direct communication) Also we can\u0027t break Dawn\u0027s public API without first sending a PSA, and only gradually. So the process to update SetIndexBuffer needs to do something like the following: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/dawn/issues/detail?id\u003d502#c8\n\nIf we could break compatibility, change would have been mostly good except that we would need validation tests for the modified validation.",
