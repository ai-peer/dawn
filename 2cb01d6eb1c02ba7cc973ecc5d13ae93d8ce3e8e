I started making this change as a learning exercise to familiarize myself with Dawn\u0027s code a bit more and didn\u0027t see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/dawn/issues/detail?id\u003d502 till I had gotten to this point.\n\nIf Jiawei has a WIP change that covers the same thing I\u0027m happy to defer to it, otherwise I can see from the issue that I\u0027ll need to make a few changes to match with the discussed migration plan.",
