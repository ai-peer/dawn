      "message": "hm, instead of hard-coding this header\n\nDawn\u0027s BUILD.gn has a `build_with_chromium` variable.\n\nWDYT of instead making the build do `dawn_version_generator.py --version-header path/to/generated/version/header`.\n\nThen, maybe we could even put the version inside Chromium\u0027s source tree instead of Dawn\u0027s. Basically, so Dawn isn\u0027t restricted to a hard-coded version path both in this generator file and in the .gitignore. Other embedders of Dawn could more easily pass in their own file.",
