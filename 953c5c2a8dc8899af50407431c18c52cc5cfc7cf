      "message": "some questions on details:\n\ndo we know if it specifically multiple resolves that are the problem? for example it could be something like resolves using a non-zero color attachment index don\u0027t work - in which case this workaround wouldn\u0027t catch the case where there is only 1 color attachment at index 2. If this is the case, then a better name might be \"VulkanAlwaysResolveUsingColorAttachmentZero\"\n\nif it is specifically that it doesn\u0027t work when there are multiple, then I think we can make the workaround slightly better by keeping 1 resolve happening in the original render pass, and doing the rest of the resolves in separate passes. I think the memory bandwidth savings would be valuable, especially in the case when there are just 2 resolve attachments.\nIn this world, I think that \"VulkanUseAtMostOneResolveAttachmentPerRenderPass\" would be a marginally better name as it\u0027s more descriptive about how the splitting happens",

      "message": "I can test some other possible variants of the bug to be sure!\n\nI originally tried to keep the first resolve on the original pass, but that was failing as well, which is why I opted to break all of them out into separate resolves.\n\nThinking about it now, though, I realize that the heuristic I\u0027m using is wrong give that\u0027s the case. I\u0027m checking that the number of resolves \u003e 1, but I should be checking for the number of color targets \u003e 1 and number of resolves \u003e\u003d 1, otherwise a pass with multiple color targets that only resolves one of them will hit the same bug.",
