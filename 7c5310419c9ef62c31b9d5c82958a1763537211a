Avoiding it is probably as simple as putting DAWN_UNLIKELY around the condition for it, but... do we want to have to do that everywhere?\nI think we used to have a DAWN_VALIDATE macro that had both the condition, AND the error message - I don\u0027t remember why we removed it.\n\nI **think** this formatting code is coming from this bit:\n    \"Expected %u entries, got %u\",\n    static_cast\u003cuint32_t\u003e(descriptor-\u003elayout-\u003eGetBindingCount()),\n    descriptor-\u003eentryCount\n\nOf course though, the code isn\u0027t actually executed unless we take that branch, but it\u0027s still not the best for the instruction cache.\n\n^this is why my suspicion is that two-phase validation is better, but if there\u0027s not a lot of overhead to the current approach, I\u0027m happy to be convinced",

I\u0027ll work on auto-generating the formatting (that\u0027ll make use a lot easier) and thanks Corentin for pointing out Abseil\u0027s user defined formats! If we can make those work in this context it\u0027ll definitely be the cleanest way to go.\n\nAlso, thank you Austin for doing the evaluation of the generated code! That\u0027s super helpful here. I\u0027ll play with having a version of the macro that does the condition and DAWN_UNLIKELY internally to see what the ergonomics of it feels like.\n\nAnd yes, I 100% agree that we should have some guidelines for how to format the error messages. I went through several revisions before posting this, and it\u0027s tricky to find a pattern that works well in all situations, but I definitely like Corentin\u0027s suggestion for flipping the context stack.\n\nI\u0027ll post an update to this CL later today and we\u0027ll keep iterating!",
