There is a special cases reference to this directory in licenses.py which now points to a file that doesn\u0027t exist. \nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:tools/licenses/licenses.py;l\u003d404?q\u003dlicenses.py\n\nI can\u0027t see a LICENSE file in any of the child directories either. Where should we be getting this license from after this change?",
