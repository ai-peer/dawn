      "message": "Hi Antonio,\n\nThis change is causing some issues with licensing and credits. There is a special cases reference to this directory in licenses.py which now points to a file that doesn\u0027t exist. \nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:tools/licenses/licenses.py;l\u003d404?q\u003dlicenses.py\n\nI can\u0027t see a LICENSE file in any of the child directories either. Where should we be getting this license from after this change?",

      "message": "Hi Rachel,\n\nFormerly, we had this extra license file checked into that subdirectory, but now we are using 2 DEPs that are mirrors of these upstream repos:\n\nhttps://github.com/KhronosGroup/EGL-Registry\nhttps://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry\n\nIt looks like neither of these repositories have a LICENSE file. For EGL-Registry, there\u0027s a Copyright notice at the top of this root file: `third_party/khronos/EGL-Registry/registry.tcl` that says:\n\n```\n# Copyright 2006-2021 The Khronos Group Inc.\n# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n```\n\nAnd for OpenGL-Registry, the root README file at `third_party/khronos/OpenGL-Registry/README.adoc` contains this header:\n\n```\n// Copyright 2017-2021 The Khronos Group Inc.\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0\n```\n\nThese two repositories were already mirrored for Chromium here:\n```\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/KhronosGroup/EGL-Registry\n```\n\nSo it\u0027s possible they are already referenced by other modules in Chromium, and therefore, the licenses are already added for licensing and credits?",

      "message": "Understand that these are DEPS\u0027d instead of being checked in but the requirement for providing 3P metadata files (README.chromium, LICENSE) is still there. Regardless of how the dependencies end up in the code, we need to acknowledge them directly where they\u0027re added. \nSee https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/adding_to_third_party.md \n\nTypically when we do this we add the LICENSE and README files in the top level `//third_party/dawn/khronos` directory to ensure they\u0027re properly credited and have their metadata set and then DEPS the code into the child directories. You can have multiple dependencies in a README file by following this structure:\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main:metadata/tests/data/README.chromium.test.multi-valid?q\u003dREADME.chromium.test.multi-valid\n\nIf we don\u0027t have these the SBOM data will be invalid and so will `about:credits`.\nRelying on the fact that someone else has credited it somewhere else might lead us into compliance trouble.",
