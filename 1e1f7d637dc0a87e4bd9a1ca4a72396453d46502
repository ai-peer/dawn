But isn\u0027t there luminance + alpha? Didn\u0027t find it in existing format. Not sure about extension \u0026 renderable.",

I will add comments saying DAWN_DEPRECATED_IF looks at the toggle while the other doesn\u0027t. It should be useful as post-V1 if we want to change any behavior, it likely needs to go through the deprecation process.",
