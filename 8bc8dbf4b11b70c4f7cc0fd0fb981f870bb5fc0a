      "message": "PTAL! I fixed up web_platform tests that were broken on workers so we can run these now.\n\n@bsheedy@google.com does this look OK from a capacity standpoint? Each of the worker steps gets longer, for example:\n\n- Win/NVIDIA goes from about 1min to 3.5min, similar on Linux\n- Mac arm64 goes from about 40s to 2-2.5min\n- Pixel 4 goes from about 1min to 18min - not sure if this is normal or something is especially slow about these tests",

      "message": "There\u0027s roughly 14x more tests now, so the increase seems reasonable. The difference in time is probably due to a combination of lack of parallelization on Android and tests being slower on Android.\n\nFor example, on Mac M2, we have:\n\n```\n[2699/2705] webgpu:web_platform,worker,worker:shared_worker: was skipped 0.0097s (worker 1)\n[2700/2705] webgpu:web_platform,worker,worker:service_worker: was skipped 0.0099s (worker 4)\n[2701/2705] webgpu:web_platform,worker,worker:dedicated_worker: passed 0.0393s (worker 3)\n```\n\nwhile on Pixel 4 we have:\n\n```\n[2699/2705] webgpu:web_platform,worker,worker:dedicated_worker: passed 0.2807s (worker 1)\n[2700/2705] webgpu:web_platform,worker,worker:service_worker: was skipped 0.0622s (worker 1)\n[2701/2705] webgpu:web_platform,worker,worker:shared_worker: was skipped 0.0662s (worker 1)\n```\n\nSo both actually running tests and skipping them are significantly slower on Pixel 4.",
