      "message": "Hi there, first time contributor here, I hope I followed all steps properly!\n\nThis is a very small change to fix `clang-cl` builds. As mentioned in the commit:\n\n1. Warnings were not being properly disabled because MSVC was being detected by the code guard for `TINT_DISABLE_WARNING_*` (because `_MSC_VER` is defined in this case too)\n2. There is a `double` comparison in the lexer that `clang` complains about, but in this case it\u0027s perfectly valid doing so. I\u0027ve added a new `TINT_DISABLE_WARNING_FLOAT_EQUAL` to deal with this case, I hope that was the right move.\n\n(BTW, this is also the first time I use Gerrit, so no idea what to do with all the \"points\" on this UI about code-review, auto-submit and commit-queue, sorry about that)",
