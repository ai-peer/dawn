      "message": "I modified the CompressedTextureFormatTests functions a bit - UploadData and GetExpectedData are now used to return data for the exact region we want to write/copy to. \n\nPreviously, we used both of them to return data for the whole texture - that was fine since the tests are using only one texel block everywhere - it was just more of the same block in data. It could have caused problems with some physical/virtual size differences though, consider the case when physicalSize.width \u003d 16, virtualSize.width \u003d 15, copyExtent.width \u003d 12 - then data for the whole texture is aligned differently than data for the region. It wasn\u0027t covered in the tests that were implemented.\n\nThe change also includes rowsPerImage alignment \n",
