      "message": "This has me wondering. Should we distinguish sampleCount 0 vs 1? E.g. on OpenGL, 0 means \"non-multisampled\", while 1 means \"possibly multisampled with at least 1 sample\". Things seem more complicated in Vulkan.\n\nThis kind of depends on (1) whether there\u0027s a difference between non-multisampled and 1-sample, and (2) if there is, whether there\u0027s a way to distinguish them other than by sample count (e.g. texture dimension).",
