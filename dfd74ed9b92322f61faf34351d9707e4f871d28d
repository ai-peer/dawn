      "message": "This has me wondering. Should we distinguish sampleCount 0 vs 1? E.g. on OpenGL, 0 means \"non-multisampled\", while 1 means \"possibly multisampled with at least 1 sample\". Things seem more complicated in Vulkan.\n\nThis kind of depends on (1) whether there\u0027s a difference between non-multisampled and 1-sample, and (2) if there is, whether there\u0027s a way to distinguish them other than by sample count (e.g. texture dimension).",

      "message": "At least in Vulkan\u0027s case, this might be because there are fixed sample counts queriable from the API, and you must use one of them. In WebGPU we might want to be looser (like OpenGL) so an application doesn\u0027t accidentally make itself hardware dependent?",
