      "message": "Here is why the test webgpu:api,operation,buffers,map_oom:mapAsync:oom\u003dtrue;size\u003d9007199254740984 fails on Win10_x86 bots:\n\n1. In the test the size exceeds kGuaranteedBufferOOMSize (std::numeric_limits\u003csize_t\u003e::max(), on x86 systems it is MAX_UINT), so it will be clamped to MAX_UINT.\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webgpu/gpu_buffer.cc;l\u003d134\n\n2. On wire_client, when we create an error buffer, mSize won\u0027t be set to 0, it will be MAX_UINT:\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/src/dawn/wire/client/Buffer.cpp;l\u003d141\n\n3. On wire_server, size64 is MAX_UINT, which is equal to WGPU_WHOLE_MAP_SIZE (std::numeric_limits\u003csize_t\u003e::max(), on x86 systems it is MAX_UINT)\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/src/dawn/wire/server/ServerBuffer.cpp;l\u003d83\n\n4. Then an WGPUBufferMapAsyncStatus_Error will be directly returned without any validations in dawn_native, so the test fails (the test checks if the validation error has been correctly generated).\n\nSo if we set mSize to 0 for OOM buffers at wire_client (like what we did before https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/109040), the step 3 will be avoided, then we will pass the test.\n\nIn fact theoretically an OOM buffer shouldn\u0027t have valid mSize, and we are using mSize in MapAsync() and GetMappedRange(), so I think we should ensure OOM buffer not have a valid mSize to avoid any potential issues about using an unexpected mSize for an OOM buffer on wire_client.",

      "message": "hmm.. thanks for the explanation!\n\nto me, I think the problem is happening in (3). with the `|| size64 \u003e\u003d WGPU_WHOLE_MAP_SIZE` part of the check. the size is equal to WHOLE_MAP_SIZE so it\u0027s erroring early before going to dawn::native for validation.\nThe intent of this code is to catch problems where the client is a 64-bit platform and the server is a 32-bit platform. So the client is expressing some size that can\u0027t be interpreted by the server. It can\u0027t even be passed into dawn::native because the 64-bit size would narrow into a 32-bit size_t. The problem is, this doesn\u0027t work very well because that means on a 32-bit server, the \"magic\" value for WHOLE_MAP_SIZE is right in the middle of the representable range of values the client might be sending.\n\nWhat we probably should do instead is have a separate boolean in the MapAsync message that indicates whether the client wants to use \"WHOLE_MAP_SIZE\" or not since over the wire in this situation, the value is an overloaded concept.\n\nHowever, applications where the client is 64-bit and the server is 32-bit don\u0027t exist right now (that we know of) so I think the simplest thing we can right now is change `|| size64 \u003e\u003d WGPU_WHOLE_MAP_SIZE` into `|| size64 \u003e WGPU_WHOLE_MAP_SIZE`.\n\nThat will let through the \u003d\u003d case which would otherwise be valid if the buffer were not an error.\nIt\u0027ll go to dawn::native and hit the correct validation",

      "message": "hm.. that code in blink is probably wrong too though since it will make the reflection information incorrect. And that\u0027s there too to avoid truncation of uint64_t from Javascript to 32-bit size_t.. The size of any mappable buffer we pass into Dawn is clamped to size_t. And, the reflection returns the size as reported by Dawn.\n\nMaybe we should change all the mapping sizes to be uint64_t to make things simpler.
