      "message": "formatInfo.format is a GLenum, not the size of the format. The size of the format can be found with dawn_native::TextureFormatPixelSize().\n\nAlternatively, you could assume that no pixel format will be more than 16 bytes (RGBA32F), and use\n\n  static constexpr MAX_TEXEL_SIZE \u003d 16;\n  ASSERT(TextureFormatPixelSize(GetFormat()) \u003c\u003d MAX_TEXEL_SIZE);\n  GLubyte clearColor[16] \u003d {};\n\nwhich avoids a heap allocation and would be much faster.\n\nAll that said, glClearTexImage is not available until OpenGL 4.4. I do not know if it is available on macOS (it could be, if ARB_clear_texture is available). It would be unfortunate to break the OpenGL backend on macOS (even though compute already doesn\u0027t work). But I can\u0027t find a reasonable alternative, so it\u0027s ok for now.",
