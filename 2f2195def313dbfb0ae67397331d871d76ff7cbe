I think 3 is slightly simpler.\n*IF* we have have a future where there\u0027s a D3D12 extension that\u0027s like \"use-lower-shader-model-for-testing\" then Patchset 4 (or Rafael\u0027s suggestion) would be better for that. I don\u0027t see a super useful case for that right now, so I weak vote Patchset 3",
