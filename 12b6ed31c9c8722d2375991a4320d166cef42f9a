      "message": "I feel this is too large as a single CL, and is missing unit tests for the new validation. I suggest splitting it into the following CLs:\n* Build support for libprotobuf-mutator: `src/tint/externals.json`, `third_party/libprotobuf-mutator/BUILD.gn`, `tools/src/cmd/gen/build/BUILD.gn.tmpl`\n* Additional IR validation: `src/tint/lang/core/ir/*`. There\u0027s a bunch of unit tests that need adding here for the new validation.\n* The new IR fuzzer: `src/tint/BUILD.gn`, `src/tint/cmd/fuzz/ir/*`, `src/tint/tint.gni`\n\nBefore the new fuzzer can land, there\u0027s additional validation that\u0027s likely needed. Locally the fuzzer still finds stuff after about a minute of testing.",
