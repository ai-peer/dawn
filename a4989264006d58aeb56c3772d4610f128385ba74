I wasn\u0027t aware of this, and tried looking up the GN documentation, [but I don\u0027t see anything](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/tools/gn/+/48062805e19b4697c5fbd926dc649c78b6aaa138/docs/language.md#Scoping-and-execution) that suggests this.\n\nIf this is actually polluting the global scope, I suggest prefixing with a partition alloc prefix. `pa_` would suffice.",
