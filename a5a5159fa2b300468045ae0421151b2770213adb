      "message": "No we don\u0027t drop VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled. It\u0027s just that we don\u0027t need to implement MSAARenderToSingleSampled using 2 subpasses anymore. So I think we should drop the DawnMultisampleStateRenderToSingleSampled chained struct. That struct was originally intended for 2 subpasses implementation in vulkan where the render pipeline has to be compatible with the render pass with 2 subpasses.\n\nIn short:\n- DawnMultisampleStateRenderToSingleSampled will be implemented using VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled directly, there is no need for pipeline \u0026 render pass\u0027 compatibility anymore.\n- DawnLoadResolveTexture will be implemented in vulkan using 2 subpasses. And it needs pipeline compatibility info such as the new struct. Because VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled is not supported on all hardwares, so still need this feature implementation as an alternative.",
