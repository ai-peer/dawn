      "message": "Considering only one last usage (or multiple in terms of read) can work but is a different strategy for handling read after read after write cases, and if you want to do it optimally I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s simpler.\n\nEg. consider compute (write) -\u003e fragment (read) -\u003e vertex (read) -\u003e compute (read) -\u003e transfer (read). This would be the worst pathological case (technically you could probably also get an indirect usage in there somewhere).\n\n1st use: `usage \u003d Storage`, `Stage \u003d Compute`. `mLastUsage \u003d None`, `mLastStage \u003d None`.\nNo barrier needed, but set `mLastUsage` and `mLastStage`.\n\n2nd use: `usage \u003d Uniform`, `stage \u003d Fragment`. `mLastUsage \u003d Storage`, `mLastStage \u003d Compute`.\nInsert a Compute -\u003e Fragment barrier. Since we\u0027re going from write to read usage we set `mLastUsage` and `mLastStage` instead of adding to them.\n\n3rd use: `usage \u003d Uniform`, `stage \u003d Fragment`. `mLastUsage \u003d Uniform`, `mLastStage \u003d Fragment`.\nThe write from the compute job is not visible in Vertex so we need to make it visible. We no longer know that the last write was in Compute so we\u0027ll insert a Fragment -\u003e Vertex barrier, which will take care of the Compute -\u003e Vertex dependency indirectly since Fragment has already waited for the write.\n\n4th use: `usage \u003d Uniform`, `stage \u003d Compute`. `mLastUsage \u003d Uniform`, `mLastStage \u003d Vertex | Fragment`.\nWe insert a Vertex | Fragment -\u003e Compute barrier.\n\n5th use: `usage \u003d CopySrc`, `stage \u003d None`. `mLastUsage \u003d Uniform`, `mLastStage \u003d Vertex | Fragment | Compute`.\nWe insert a Vertex | Fragment | Compute -\u003e Transfer barrier.\n\nWe can optimize this. While we need each barrier, we can optimize the source stages. These are read-\u003eread barriers so we don\u0027t actually need to wait for Vertex | Fragment | Compute. We just need to wait for something that we know has waited for the last write. So instead of waiting for all stages, pick one. Prioritize Vertex over Fragment since it\u0027s earlier in the pipeline. Otherwise pick arbitrarily (how to prioritize stages would depend on what content does).\n\nOf course this is a contrived case. It\u0027s unlikely we\u0027ll see something *that* bad.",
