While looking at the code that calls ExecutePendingCommandContext, it seemed hard to verify that the change in behavior by the previous CL was safe since we wouldn\u0027t call NextSerial() in some cases (e.g. no pending commands). So I reverted back to the original code and made SynchronizeImportedTextureAfterUse use GetPendingCommandSerial instead of GetLastSubmittedSerial.",
