      "message": "Correct myself about comment above. Looks like bots do run 3D texture related CTS even though it is marked as DisallowedUnsafeAPIs. \n\nThe failed test is marked as Crash in WebGPUExpections but it is Timeout right now. Maybe that is the reason that the bots failed. This change didn\u0027t do anything except it removes a couple ASSERTs for resource transition. Maybe the crash was caused by the ASSERTs but now they are gone?",
