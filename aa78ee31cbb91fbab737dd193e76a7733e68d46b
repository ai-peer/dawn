      "message": "Thank you for your contribution.\n\nPlease can I ask why you want an install target?\n\nWe don\u0027t encourage pre-builts as we\u0027ve made no efforts to provide a stable API.\nWe\u0027ve also made little effort to support shared objects.\n\nThis adds _all_ the dawn, tint and third_party headers to the install directory, and almost none of this is meant to be public API.\n\nI\u0027m concerned that this gives the impression that we support pre-builts when we actively discourage them (right now).",

      "message": "At the moment I want to include it into a bigger project that has multiple dependencies. Our build tools build things from source and run cmake install to include everything as all other libraries normally do. Do you have a recommendation on how I should depend on dawn as a library?",
