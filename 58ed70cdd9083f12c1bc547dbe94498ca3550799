Maybe something like (for a query set of size 7)\n\n 0 - not written (tests starting with not written)\n 1 - written (tests combing multiple written, although other tests already do it.)\n 2 - written\n 3 - not written (tests skipping over not written in the middle)\n 4 - not written\n 5 - written (tests another written query in the middle)\n 6 - not written (tests the last query not being written)",
