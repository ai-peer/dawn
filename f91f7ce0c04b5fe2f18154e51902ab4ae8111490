Those conversions wrap (i.e. modulo 2**32)).\n\nBut I think this constant evaluation will only ever take effect\nwhen the validator says it\u0027s ok to perform that conversion. And therefore it consults the ConversionRank to see if its ok; and it\u0027s not ok to do those conversions i32 \u003c-\u003e u32.   That is, the permissible conversions are those that are clamped / snapped in the way that CheckedConvert does it.",
