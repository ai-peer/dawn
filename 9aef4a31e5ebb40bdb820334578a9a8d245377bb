      "message": "Nice! I think we should wait till switching Dawn to use third_party/vulkan-deps instead of adding more vulkan dependencies to synchronize like vulkan_tools. Now also seeing vulkan_memory_allocator here.. seems like this should be moved into vulkan-deps as well?",

I\u0027m in the process of rolling it forward. That doesn\u0027t block adopting it with the current pinned revs which should be similar to what you use now.",

That\u0027s why I added angle_standalone to ANGLE first.\n\nAnd yeah, we should totally do that for the DEPS, too (Jamie and I discussed it).
