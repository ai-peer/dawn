      "message": "Nice! I think we should wait till switching Dawn to use third_party/vulkan-deps instead of adding more vulkan dependencies to synchronize like vulkan_tools. Now also seeing vulkan_memory_allocator here.. seems like this should be moved into vulkan-deps as well?",

I\u0027m in the process of rolling it forward. That doesn\u0027t block adopting it with the current pinned revs which should be similar to what you use now.",
