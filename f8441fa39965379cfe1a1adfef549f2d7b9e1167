      "message": "Austin: Corentin and I discussed this earlier today. We were both surprised that it\u0027s not required to set the image handle in this case explicitly to nullptr, but I didn\u0027t see anything in either the spec or code snippets online/in Ganesh-Vulkan that do so (and YCbCr sampling works on my Pixel 4a without doing so). WDYT?\n\nAdditionally, Corentin suggested testing this via a test of YCbCr sampling, relying on VVL to detect the error. However, I turned on VVL locally and saw that there is no validation error without this change :\\. Do we already have end2end tests that use YCbCr sampling in Dawn? That would be further evidence that this problem isn\u0027t caught by VVL.",
