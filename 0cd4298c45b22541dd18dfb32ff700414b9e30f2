      "message": "Ben, this patch, plus the following one in the chain fixed the problem for me. I was able to reproduce on Windows. We\u0027ll have to land this one, then have a Chromium CL to put the new binary on the bots, and then land the following one which removes the problematic white_box test sources from the end2end_tests.\n\nI think I\u0027ll wait till Corentin is back from vacation for this. He may have opinions about splitting the tests into two binaries.",
