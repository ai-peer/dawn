      "message": "Thanks! This feels like it intersects with the discussion on the next CL of how to store the static sampler for later usage [1] - if we did it this way, it seems like it could then be natural to add a `StaticSampler`(*) struct that is its own variant in `BindingInfo`?\n\nThis also feels like it intersects with the discussion on that CL of not passing bind group entries for static samplers [2] - if we did it this way, then that check would just boil down to \"if the layout entry at a given index is of type `StaticSampler`, there shouldn\u0027t be any bind group entry at that index\"?\n\nThe downside of doing it this way would be if there\u0027s a significant amount of code/logic that would have to be duplicated between the usage of`SamplerBindingLayout` and the usage of the new `StaticSamplerBindingLayout`. I don\u0027t have intuition there.\n\nCorentin, Austin: WDYT?\n\n(*) Name to be bikeshed - `StaticSamplerBindingLayout` feels misleading because we couldn\u0027t directly store the struct from the client itself as we do for e.g. `SamplerBindingLayout` but would need to create something new to have an owning ref to the static sampler object IIUC.\n\n[1] https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/180384/comment/400f32da_9bb0e8a0/\n[2] https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/180384/comment/67da0c98_d0b52d4e/",

      "message": "Yeah if we did this, there would be an additional variant for the static sampler, and that would be used for the validation that a sampler isn\u0027t passed.\n\nI\u0027m not sure that there would be that much duplication of code to handle the new binding type but I\u0027m not 100% sure. Overall I have a slight preference for making this change but don\u0027t want to block things on it.",
