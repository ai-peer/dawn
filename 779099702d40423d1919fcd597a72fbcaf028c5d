Right now Chromium imports ANGLE\u0027s version\n\nI remember trying to add vulkan-loader to Dawn but finding that in a Chromium build both ANGLE and Dawn were producing this target which is a BUILD.gn error. We could point Dawn to ANGLE\u0027s vulkan-loader, but then we\u0027ll probably run into breakages if ANGLE\u0027s version differs from ours.",
