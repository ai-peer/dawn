      "message": "I tried adding the same field to `sem::Reference`, but it didn\u0027t quite work out. The problem is that when processing, say, `v[i] \u003d ...`, the semantic info for v` is a `VariableUser`, and where we process this in the Resolver, it\u0027s not easy to store that this identifier expression is actually a partial reference (i.e. is the object of an index accessor expression).
