      "message": "Keep deprecated depth functional and add DeprecatedAPITests\n\nSearching the webgpu spec for GPUExtent3D gives the following functions that could passed in depth from outside\n\nCreateTexture\nCopyBufferToTexture\nCopyTextureToBuffer\nCopyTextureToTexture\nWriteTexture\nCopyImageBitmapToTexture\n\nThe last seems unimplemented so added logic to generate warning/errors and adjust GPUExtent3D input for the first 4 functions. I think that would be enough? Let me know if I miss something.\n\nOr change the struct to use getter/setter for the field? (don\u0027t think it\u0027s the right way to go for deprecated api)",
