See this e2e test for example:\nhttps://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/91881/3/test/tint/builtins/gen/atomicCompareExchangeWeak/12871c.wgsl.expected.glsl#b70\n\nProblem is that for GLSL, like HLSL, requires that we pass the module variable directly to atomic functions, so we can\u0027t create a helper function that passes it in as an arg. So now this is like HLSL, inlining the code instead of calling a helper.",
