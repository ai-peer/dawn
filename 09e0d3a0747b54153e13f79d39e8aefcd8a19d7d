      "message": "Something that\u0027s not really clear from this CL is how frequently these proxy methods are used? I would think that overall we\u0027d generally want to work with the internal object as much as possible (This object should only be necessary for validation). So I would have expected to see a few more methods that had been updated to accept the BGLInternalBase object instead.\n\nThat said, it\u0027s already a big CL so if there is anything that can reasonably be done in that direction it could wait for a followup.",
