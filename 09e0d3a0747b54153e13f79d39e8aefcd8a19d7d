      "message": "Something that\u0027s not really clear from this CL is how frequently these proxy methods are used? I would think that overall we\u0027d generally want to work with the internal object as much as possible (This object should only be necessary for validation). So I would have expected to see a few more methods that had been updated to accept the BGLInternalBase object instead.\n\nThat said, it\u0027s already a big CL so if there is anything that can reasonably be done in that direction it could wait for a followup.",

      "message": "Yea, so my plan was to just use a proxy for everything here and then go over in follow ups to remove all the proxy calls. I figured it would be easier to review that way since the changes will be more localized with this one being massive but logically simple since it\u0027s just a full-on passthrough.\n\nBut yea, totally agree that the proxy should become more and more simple as I finish cleaning it up!",
