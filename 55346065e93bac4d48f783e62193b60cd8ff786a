      "message": "This CL spawns two important discussions:\n\n - Did WebNN go through https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/docs/adding_to_third_party.md#Get-a-review ? While you\u0027re integrating in the Dawn repo, it really is a new third-party library that you are looking to copy paste into the Dawn repo.\n - What do we see the final directory structure be like? IMHO we shouldn\u0027t have a webnn directory and instead have it do the same as other Dawn library:\n \n  src/webnn_wire src/webnn_native etc. The biggest question is for tests because they are not correctly namespaces right now. I think it could be src/tests/dawn/{white_box, validation, perf, end2end} src/tests/unittests and src/tests/webnn/* same thing for fuzzers.\n  \nAustin, Jiawei, kainino WDYT?",

IIRC, webnn would like to use some of it as well. maybe some of src/common stays where it is and we alias stuff into the dawn:: or webnn:: namespaces.",
