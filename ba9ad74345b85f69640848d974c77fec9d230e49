      "message": "I added TransitionForPass that we had in vulkan and d3d12 to go through all the textures and initialize them before the render pass and compute pass ( I can probably rename it to \"InitializeForPass\"). But since that happens before generating the framebuffers and linking them glClearBuffer doesn\u0027t work, and an error occurs.\n\nin patch 1, I had checked in TransitionForPass that if it was a depth/stencil texture then skip the clear call, but it failed in the try job. I couldn\u0027t repro that fail locally, so I added this check here but it doesn\u0027t seem right to me, I think I need to fix the logic somewhere else.",
