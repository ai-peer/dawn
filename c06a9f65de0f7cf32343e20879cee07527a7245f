      "message": "LGTM, but I\u0027d like Corentin to review again and be aware of the discussion here in case he sees any gaps\n\nPeng and I discussed this and here were my takeaways:\n - Feature::DawnMultiPlanarFormats used to be just for importing of HANDLE/fd, but it has since then changed to also include de-novo creation of a multiplanar texture. These texture formats are always supported on FL11_0 so we can unconditionally say that are supported in D3D. (d3d12/metal already work this way; Vulkan checks if the formats are supported)\n\n - Import of multiplanar textures with d3d11 device doesn\u0027t need a feature because it always works so long as the devices are the same (which we validate)\n\n - Import of multiplanar DXGI HANDLE also does not need a feature exposed because assuming the caller passes a valid HANDLE, then the caller needs to have successfully created that HANDLE. That means the caller needs to have successfully exported that HANDLE - which would not be possible if the device did not have sharedResourceTier2. In short, Dawn doesn\u0027t need the feature for import operations. We would need to expose such a feature if we allowed export of multiplanar share handles, but we don\u0027t have export today.",
