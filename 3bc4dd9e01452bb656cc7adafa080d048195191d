Sorry for my bad memory.\n\n\u003e for future new state\n\nSomething like MapState::Pending, isn\u0027t it? I added a comment.\n\nI first tried to add MapState::Pending but I gave up because the WebGPU spec describes that [[internal]].state \u003d\u003d available validation check is done in the device timeline. So I decided to introduce a new bool flag mPendingMap because mapped state shouldn\u0027t be overridden with pending map state.",
