      "message": "Yes. Yesterday I mentioned this situation actually: if user defined copySize.height is 1, say copySize is {4, 1, 3}, and there is an empty row at the first copy depth slice, then the first copy which copy (copySize.height - 1) rows will be 0 row.  It is a special case. I also mentioned this scenario in the document I am writing. And it is added to the test cases at https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/51320/1/src/tests/end2end/CopyTests.cpp#1067 and https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/51320/1/src/tests/end2end/CopyTests.cpp#1086",
