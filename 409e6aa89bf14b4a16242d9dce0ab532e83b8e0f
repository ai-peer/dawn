      "message": "could we add the same thing to GL?\n\nsorry for the churn, but I requested we do it in the frontend since I thought it might be less error prone than modifying every usage in the backends.\nbut since Vulkan/D3D have a single point for \"use the resource now\" and we\u0027ve now made Metal the same, it seems better to do that for GL as well.\n\nWe can do GL as a follow-up too, but overall it seems like we won\u0027t need these two variants of IterateResourcesForSubmit.\n\n\nFor GL, for now, we can instead change:\n `TrackTask(std::unique_ptr\u003cTrackTaskCallback\u003e task, ExecutionSerial serial)`\n\n\nto:\n```\nif (gl) {\n  force an eventual flush\n  serial \u003d ScheduledWorkDoneSerial()\n}\n```\nwith a TODO about fixing the behavior\n(so it does the same as if you called TrackTaskForEventualFlush)",
