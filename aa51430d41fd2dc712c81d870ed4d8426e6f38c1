      "message": "This is my first stab at filling out the CompilationInfo with something useful. It\u0027s slightly awkward, and I\u0027m open to suggestions on improving it. A few things that may or may not be a concern off the top of my head:\n\n - If messages are generated during validation but the validation succeeds they\u0027re currently being discarded. (Only error ShaderModules get the validation messages.) I can fix this, but it also looks like some of the validation is being re-run when a valid ShaderModule is created, so it\u0027s possible we\u0027re getting them anyway?\n - ShaderModuleMTL may miss out on some messages because part of the shader is generated at RenderPipeline creation time, and I currently have a restriction that messages can\u0027t be added after the CompilationMessages are able to be queried.\n - There\u0027s a whole pile of Validation errors that aren\u0027t directly from Tint that this system ignores currently. And maybe that\u0027s working as intended? I\u0027m not sure.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027d love some feedback!",
