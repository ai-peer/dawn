      "message": "[proposal] We are starting to have a bunch of gathering of things between this, width, height, sampleCount and validation at [1]. WDYT of having a class like:\n\n\n```\nclass RenderPassValidationState : public NonMovable {\n  public:\n    MaybeError AddAttachment(view, depthSlice \u003d 0);\n    \n    GetWidth/Height/SampleCount();\n    HasAttachment() {return width !\u003d0;}\n\n  private:\n    uint32_t width \u003d 0;\n    uint32_t height \u003d 0;\n    uint32_t sampleCount \u003d 0;\n\n    // Whatever is needed to make sure no attachment is used twice.\n};\n```\n\nThen propagate this in functions that need them by pointer.\n\nIt makes it easier to have everything in the same spot, also checks that StorageAttachment and RenderAttachment don\u0027t alias, is more consistent and code reuse etc.",
