      "message": "Why does this need to be a member (apart from the fact the code before had it this way)? It seems like the command recording context could be mostly transient in SubmitImpl.\n\nAlternatively, like in the Vulkan backend, the Device can always have a CommandRecordingContext available that is exposed via GetCommandRecordingContext. This way in [1] we don\u0027t have to handle potentially two command recording context: there is only the \"current device recording context\". WDYT? This would also remove the need for MaybeError on GetPendingCommandList because there would always be a CommandRecordingContext open (its creation can only fail at Device init or at the end of ExecutePendingCommandRecordingContext)",

      "message": "The documentation for Reset says that calling Reset is preferred over re-creating the command list because you can reuse command list tracking structures. So we do not want to make commandlist creation be a transient operation.\n\nI originally moved the opening of pending command list to device initialization but that caused problems in cases where nobody used it because resetting the command allocator would fail if there existing command lists opened. This is why I changed GetPendingCommandList to return an error.\n\nI will try removing the CommandRecordingContext out of the queue such that we only have one recording context in the device like the Vulkan backend does.",
