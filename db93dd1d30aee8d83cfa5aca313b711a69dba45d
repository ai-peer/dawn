Even if there was some other error, I think it\u0027s correct to consider the commands \"submitted\" and ineligible for submission again.\n\n^(we should have a test for this)\n\nTo simplify the error handling, we can add a private QueueBase::SubmitInternal which contains the original contents of this function. Then, always Clear() the commands after calling SubmitInternal.",
