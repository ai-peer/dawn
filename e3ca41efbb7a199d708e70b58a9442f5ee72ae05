      "message": "yea - overall LGTM but since this wasn\u0027t clean, could you try making a chromium CL for M104 that points DEPS to this CL to help verify that Chrome works? CQ should work on the Chromium release branch.\n\nIn the past we\u0027ve used this process:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1zi7-8iGsfXa6FZ15DPFYgxI_ZwAMs-tmOVulwu1APrk/edit#heading\u003dh.1igmipovlrl\n\nI hope it still works - it looks like someone crossed out the step that says to click CQ Dry Run. If that doesn\u0027t work, perhaps we can test locally in Chrome.",
