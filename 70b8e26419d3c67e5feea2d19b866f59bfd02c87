      "message": "Wouldn\u0027t this path work for compressed textures? I think that \"cleared\" for compressed textures will end up being defined as \"whatever all zeros decompresses into\". Although not sure about the NonZero case; all 0x01s might not be a valid pattern in all formats. Probably ok to use though.\n\nThen the TODO above can become a \"TODO: test compressed texture initial values\"",
