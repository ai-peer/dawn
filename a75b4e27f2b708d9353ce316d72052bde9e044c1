Is it OK to ask you questions about the whole process here or is there somewhere else I\u0027m supposed to do that.\n\nFor instance, I though I\u0027d look at another issue, but how do I know if someone else is working on it? Who assigns issues I guess? It\u0027s marked \u0027approved\u0027 so I\u0027m guessing someone wants it done, but by who?",
