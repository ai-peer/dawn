If there\u0027s more than one workaround, we\u0027re going to want the recursive patching mechanism Corentin originally implemented for Metal. Could be better to move it wholesale to the frontend if possible",

We still want the user to be able to override to turn of the workaround (for testing against improved driver versions, or etc.).\n\nForceSetToggle should be used when it wouldn\u0027t work at all.
