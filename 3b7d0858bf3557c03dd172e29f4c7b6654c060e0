      "message": "I anticipate transitions for all of the subresources at once to be more common than transitioning ones with different states. With your new code, we now submit a barrier for each and every subresource instead of submitting one barrier for all of them at once.\n\nWhat is the performance impact of this change on a site like ForestDemo? If we see a regression, we should keep D3D12_RESOURCE_BARRIER_ALL_SUBRESOURCES as a special case.",

      "message": "This is a correctness problem, we should do (or should have the ability to do) transition barrier per each subresource. You can refer to the updated description of this patch for details.\n\nHowever, what you are saying could be the next step: optimization. We can combine the barriers into a single one if the usages of all src subresources are the same and the usages of all dst subresources are the same too. I will do this soon.",
