With your new code, we now submit a barrier for each and every subresource instead of submitting one barrier for all of them at once.\n\nWhat is the performance impact of this change on a site like ForestDemo? If we see a regression, we should keep D3D12_RESOURCE_BARRIER_ALL_SUBRESOURCES as a special case.",
