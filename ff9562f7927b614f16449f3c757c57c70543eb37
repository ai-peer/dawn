I believe it\u0027s because the clear values are not actually part of the render pass; at least in Vulkan, they can be set when the render pass is begun: VkRenderPassBeginInfo.pClearValues.\n\nLooks like we didn\u0027t even add clear values to the sketch until https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/80 .\nI\u0027m not sure whether we had an investigation or discussion where we decided to do it this way.",
