We can move bits of CMake out to utility files, but I\u0027m not sure that would help with the structure.\n\n\u003e Also any way to not have to add the compile options manually for each library?\n\nYou can globally change build options, but it becomes a bit of a nightmare when you have outer projects wanting to include dawn / tint. Leakage becomes a real issue.\n\n\u003e Tint CMakeLists didn\u0027t need a change.\n\nThey don\u0027t because they already use `tint_default_compile_options()` for all targets:\nhttps://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/+/refs/heads/main/src/tint/CMakeLists.txt#54",
