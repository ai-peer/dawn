Maybe we need to do\n\n if (extension)\n    load with KHR\n else if (\u003e 1.1)\n    load without KHR suffix\n\n The problem is that they would go to two different members of VulkanFunctions, so maybe we can modify GET_INSTANCE_PROC to take an optional extension suffix so it loads with the suffix but stores in the member without the suffix.\n\nWDYT?",
