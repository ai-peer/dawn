      "message": "Do they? It\u0027s a cross-invocation load and subtraction(s). I struggle with the concept that they directly affect values in other invocations.\nI guess I have the same objection to `kWorkgroupUniformLoad` being included in `HasSideEffects()`, [which I see was added in this CL](https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/114862/15/src/tint/sem/builtin.cc).\n\nPerhaps the definition of \"side-effects\" needs refining. It currently has the comment:\n\n```\n/// Determines if the given `f` may have side-effects (i.e. writes to at least one of its inputs)\n/// @returns true if intrinsic may have side-effects\n```\n\nWhich is not particularly explicit in its definition.\n\nIt seems what we\u0027re trying to describe here is functions that have an observable impact on other instructions (aside from their result value). I hadn\u0027t really considered uniformity to play a part in this definition.\n\nEither way, we should the function\u0027s comment to be more descriptive - and possibly rename the helper.\n\nAlternatively to including uniformity in \"side-effects\", we could have another function for describing whether the function must be called in uniform control flow (aside: this is something that could and probably should be declared in the .def files via an attribute).",
