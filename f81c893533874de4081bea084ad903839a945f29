      "message": "is it necessary to make the size larger?\n\nI think we need to also test the case where the copy touches the last byte in the buffer. This could be a problem because it effectively means the buffer size internally needs to be padded to be padded AND we need to be able to read/write to the padding. Consider the case where you have a 3x3 copy region, so the last texel is inside the buffer, but because we read/write a u32, half of the u32 is actually outside the buffer.",
