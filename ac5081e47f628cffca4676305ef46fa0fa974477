I think most of Corentin\u0027s comment have also been addressed so I closed them to remove the clutter!\n\nFinal note: I wanted to make sure that the `Instance` clears out the `EventManager` given the ref-cycle. Maybe I missed it, but I didn\u0027t see that handling?",

If the device is gone, I assume that the callback can just be fired either as a `Shutdown` case or as a success to make it look like the device isn\u0027t gone. Probably just depends on what we decide for the contract.",
