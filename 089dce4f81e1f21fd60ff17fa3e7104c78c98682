      "message": "@Ryan, I have ran the the code against other tests. Some tests, like DrawTest, complete successfully. However, tests that index into a local array fail due to missing GLSLstd450SClamp in the SPIRV reader and invalid HLSL array assignments. It seems that HLSL supports initializers during declaration but not assignments. For example, \"float arr[2] \u003d {1,2};\" works but \"float arr[2]; arr \u003d {1,2};\" fails.\n\n ",

This is the first I\u0027d heard of these mis-compliations to HLSL and don\u0027t want to lose track of them.\n\nIf you can please paste the WGSL source and the resulting bad compilation we can start to get them fixed up.\n\nSounds like there are 2 issues, 1 for the missing support for `SClamp` reading and one for HLSL assignments?",
