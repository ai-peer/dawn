      "message": "Haven\u0027t gone through this all yet, but why a shared pointer instead of just a poitner? I think this goes against the style guide on usage of shared pointers:\n\n`Do not design your code to use shared ownership without a very good reason. One such reason is to avoid expensive copy operations, but you should only do this if the performance benefits are significant, and the underlying object is immutable (i.e., std::shared_ptr\u003cconst Foo\u003e). If you do use shared ownership, prefer to use std::shared_ptr.`",
