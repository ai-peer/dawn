      "message": "@cwallez In chat, Ben suggested that perhaps we want a more specific flag like \"fxc_optimizations\" set to false by default. The reason I went for this flag was that it was more general, and could be used to disable DXC optimizations in the future. However, I admit that it\u0027s confusing that this flag is true for FXC, but false for DXC. What do you think?",
