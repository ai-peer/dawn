      "message": "@Ben - I think you mentioned we could get rid of this branch by extending the matrix. I assume you mean moving to a mat3x4 and always subtracting the additional constants from the y,u,v values. This sounds good, but I wasn\u0027t sure what the most eloquent way to get a mat3x3 out of a mat3x4 was - could you give me an example?",
