Although, I\u0027m not sure if its even possible to know when all pipelines will be created so do let me know. \n\nI also guessed there wouldn\u0027t be more than 10k pipelines and just used this macro.",

      "message": "Like enga@ mentioned on the bug, I think we just want a counter for the number of CreateRenderPipeline calls that result in a cache miss. IIUC AddOrGetCachedRenderPipeline is only called for pipelines that were compiled from scratch (i.e. cache miss) for both the sync and async paths. The other kind is pipelines which don\u0027t define a layout and therefore do not use the cache - you\u0027ll have to increment the total count for those in CreateRenderPipeline(Async).",
