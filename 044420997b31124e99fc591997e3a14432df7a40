      "message": "Maybe this should use some precomputed bitmask of which backends are available based on what the dawn_native::Instance has. It would make the list of tests that run match the available backends. (and avoid duplicated and differing logic). It would also avoid the need to support skipping tests when the backend isn\u0027t supported because we know it will be filtered in that case.",

      "message": "I spent a long time trying to do this but never really succeeded. IsBackendAvailable is called in the static initialization of DAWN_INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE. So we don\u0027t get a chance to make the backends unavailable because it runs before any test or test environment constructor or SetUp().\n\nMaybe we could glfwInit() in a static initializer as well, but that sounds gross.\n\nThat being said, I would like to come back to this at some point to see if there\u0027s a way to make it work nicely.",
