      "message": "the queue transfer here only applies to the specified subresource range.\n\nThat means if we import an external texture, copy into one subresource (which will do the transfer), and then copy into a second subresource, we\u0027ll miss doing the queue transfer for the second resource because we\u0027ve changed |mExternalState| to Acquired.\n\nThat being said.. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible for us to have multi-subresource external images. So we can add a comment about it here and also ASSERT that levelCount and layerCount are 1.",
