      "message": "It\u0027s easier for callers to select from the values of an enum (like a command line flag) than it is to conditionally dispatch to different static methods. The ANSI implementations are going to sit in the same .cc file, as it\u0027s not a target-dependent build condition. Having the switch in the implementation file seems (to me) preferable than forcing the caller to conditionally dispatch.",
