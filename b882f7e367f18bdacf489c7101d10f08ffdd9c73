      "message": "Corentin, you mentioned that after we recompute/modify the copy regions to handle empty row problem, we can re-iterate the new copy regions and see that if copySubresource.copies[i].copySize.height is 0 (it only happens when original copySize.height is 1) , we need to re-re-compute copy regions: https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/51282/2/src/dawn_native/d3d12/TextureCopySplitter.cpp#287. But I feel like we can\u0027t reuse the recomputed copy regions, so we can handle copySize.height \u003d 1 directly alongside other situations as a separate scenario. Please see the comment change between patchset 1 and patch set 2. \n\nBtw, Compute3DTextureCopySplits will be complicated, it will not be like its counterpart Compute2DTextureCopySplits. Instead, it will be very like ComputeTextureCopySubresource.",
