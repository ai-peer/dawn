      "message": "I think at the moment it\u0027s fine because we call `EventManager::TrackedEvent::EnsureComplete` in `WorkDoneEvent::~WorkDoneEvent()` which effectively handles that. We could probably consider moving that call directly into `EventManger::TrackedEvent::~TrackedEvent()` later one since it\u0027s not obvious? But the check in there right now does help at least make sure it doesn\u0027t happen.",
