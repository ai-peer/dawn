The `tintd` executable is part of the language-server package which is included in a VSCode extension.\n\nThis is a command line tool for locally installing the `tintd` extension into VSCode, via a symlink. Run via `tools/run tintd install`. I have named this `tintd` because I intend to add more sub-commands, like `tools/run tintd publish` to publish the extension on the VSCode marketplace.",
