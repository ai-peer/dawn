      "message": "No, so device lost does not destroy stuff eagerly. Idr why we decided this but I do remember this was deliberate.\n\nYes, the second point is the cause of the issue and the other changes fix that. I am adding this because this makes it clear that the function is dependent on the device being functional. Right now I think it doesn\u0027t matter if we hit the error early or later because encoding happens at the very end of this function. But in case in the future something changes, I wanted to make sure that it\u0027s clear this function should essentially be no-op if the device is bad to prevent other leaks.",
