      "message": "Latest patch makes the Device internal fence shared and makes TextureD3D12 record the value after ExecuteCommandLists. I had to move around the call to NextSerial() from the Device to the CommandRecordingContext since we want the fence value there - otherwise we would need an additional call on CommandRecordingContext to propagate the fence value to the texture.\n\nI\u0027ve also significantly expanded the ConcurrentAccess test to use multiple devices and therefore fences. I also had to extend several test helpers to take an optional device parameter so that we can check pixels on different devices.\n\nPTAL again - I\u0027ve cleaned it up sufficiently for a real review. Thanks!",
