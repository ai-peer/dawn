Other than perhaps some separation, given that there\u0027s a quite a lot of methods in `ProgramBuilder::TypesBuilder` and we\u0027ll probably want most of them in IR land too.\n\nAlternatively, why shouldn\u0027t these just live in `type::Manager`? Then they\u0027re also accessible to non-IR testing code too. `ir.types.Get\u003ctype::I32\u003e()` would become `ir.types.I32()`.",

      "message": "The extra indirection becomes useful for distinction between building a type and building an expression. `b.ty.vec3\u003cf32\u003e()` is clear that you\u0027re building a `vec3\u003cf32\u003e` type, and not attempting to build an `vec3\u003cf32\u003e` constructor expression. Not sure if we\u0027d end up with IR fluent helpers like that for expressions, but it doesn\u0027t seem infeasible.\n\nI\u0027m fine with them living in `type::Manager`. I\u0027d prefer it if the builder methods had the same capitalization as the WGSL types. While it contradicts our function style, I personally feel its a bit more fluent to keep the symbols symmetrical between WGSL and the C++ helpers.",
