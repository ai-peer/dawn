      "message": "LGTM.\n\nIt\u0027s not clear to me why we need to distinguish between the two different override cases though (`NamedOverrideArrayCount` vs `UnnamedOverrideArrayCount`)? It looks like nothing post-resolve cares about the difference. Can\u0027t we just have a `OverrideArrayCount` that stores a `sem::Expression`?\n\nI\u0027m probably missing something as I haven\u0027t yet caught up on how all this stuff is being handled.",

      "message": "It\u0027s about equality.\nYou want `NamedOverrideArrayCount` to have equality with another, if the names are the same. This happens because the structure holds the *variable*. If we tried to fold `NamedOverrideArrayCount` and `UnnamedOverrideArrayCount`, then the common field would be a `sem::Expression`, but they wouldn\u0027t have equality even in the named case, as you\u0027d have two different `sem::VariableUser`s.",
