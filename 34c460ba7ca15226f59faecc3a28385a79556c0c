      "message": "I see that a lot of work went into this, but I don\u0027t know that the gains justify the additional noise and complexity:\n\n - RenderPipeline stuff can be done just in the frontend, once in validation and once in the constructor.\n - Sampler stuff could be moved to be in the frontend.\n - aspects() seems to be the only annoying one. Maybe we can do the defaulting on the encoder/device/queue top level methods and copy on the stack for the defaulting if need be.\n\n(to de-risk it would be possible to split in different CLs too)",

This makes sense. I will try these!\n\nFor any leftovers I think it will be fine to do defaulting on a copy. I started trying this and it wasn\u0027t that bad.",
