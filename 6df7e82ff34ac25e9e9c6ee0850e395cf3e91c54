      "message": "Hmm, IIUC, a lot of the VulkanInstance code is just from the old BackendVk. Is there anyway that we could force the revision to see it as a copy and modification so it\u0027s easier to review? Maybe something like what is suggested here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16937359/git-copy-file-preserving-history (Not sure how feasible/easy it would be)\n\nWould be nice to preserve the history also instead of having the file look entirely new.",
