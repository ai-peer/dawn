      "message": "My issue with this is it makes the error less specific, like, it no longer points to the `\u0026\u0026` which was the first issue but the start of the expression and you have to find the issue yourself?\n\nIf I had something like `a \u0026\u0026 b \u0026\u0026 (c \u0026\u0026 (d \u0026\u0026 e || f)))` does it end up pointing at `a` or `d`? Like, does it at least end up pointing to the invalid subexpression or the entire thing and you\u0027re left to sort out where the problem lies?",
