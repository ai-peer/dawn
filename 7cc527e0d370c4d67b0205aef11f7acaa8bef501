      "message": "(note: this patch stack is not fully tested yet)\nSo this is what it would look like if we did the extra ref counting in dawn_native.\n\nI didn\u0027t try it in dawn_wire just yet, because I\u0027m not sure it actually solves our problem.\nThe issue is that a bad app could manage to destroy a device before the child objects. A linked list in the wire doesn\u0027t save us there because we can still destroy the device before child objects. I guess it does allow us to detect when this happens and lose the context. I feel iffy about this as it seems like a rather heavyweight solution rather than making the whole system more robust and resistant to failure.",

      "message": "I\u0027m still a bit worried about this because it\u0027s not clear how to handle cyclical references that are added later for example for lazily created internal pipelines: the device owns a unique_ptr to the InternalPipelineStore that owns a Ref\u003c\u003e to a Pipeline that owns a Ref\u003c\u003e to the device.\n\nThe only other alternative I see is that the device knows the pointer to all child objects, either via a linked list, or via handles (like the handle allocator in dawn_wire\u0027s server) and calls \"Destroy()\" on all of them inside device\u0027s destruction.",

      "message": "for the pipeline example, we can always bump the self count. overall I think we have pretty clean ownership paths, not arbitrary cycles like in JS.\n\nthe list in the wire is ok too but it is a quite a few changes to how things work there since there is no server::Device object. In the autogenerated code we resolve ObjectIds directly to C handles, so we\u0027ll need make some new structs to deserialize into. Overall felt like a heavy stopgap when pretty much all the other Googlers using Dawn outside our team have run into issues where they don\u0027t realize they need to keep the device alive - and the internal refs would save them there too.\n\nthen again I was thinking about this again, and it would be bad if Dawn\u0027s webgpu.h kept the device alive and Rust wgpu didn\u0027t, so it\u0027s something we should clarify for the C API first. I suspect we\u0027ll decide on no internal ref counting which would make the wire solution the way to go, and we just lose the context if you do it wrong.",
