      "message": "(note: this patch stack is not fully tested yet)\nSo this is what it would look like if we did the extra ref counting in dawn_native.\n\nI didn\u0027t try it in dawn_wire just yet, because I\u0027m not sure it actually solves our problem.\nThe issue is that a bad app could manage to destroy a device before the child objects. A linked list in the wire doesn\u0027t save us there because we can still destroy the device before child objects. I guess it does allow us to detect when this happens and lose the context. I feel iffy about this as it seems like a rather heavyweight solution rather than making the whole system more robust and resistant to failure.",

      "message": "I\u0027m still a bit worried about this because it\u0027s not clear how to handle cyclical references that are added later for example for lazily created internal pipelines: the device owns a unique_ptr to the InternalPipelineStore that owns a Ref\u003c\u003e to a Pipeline that owns a Ref\u003c\u003e to the device.\n\nThe only other alternative I see is that the device knows the pointer to all child objects, either via a linked list, or via handles (like the handle allocator in dawn_wire\u0027s server) and calls \"Destroy()\" on all of them inside device\u0027s destruction.",
