Mind taking an initial look for overall approach?\n\n- I\u0027ve tested this by hacking up some examples and I believe it\u0027s solid, but\n  I\u0027ll be adding proper unit tests to the CL soon.\n- Not sure about the scratch buffer. Right now it\u0027s super dumb never shrinks.\n- Maybe we could be more efficient about copying Entry data; at least writing\n  the firstInvalidIndex from CPU to each Entry could maybe be done in one big\n  write; trade-off is possibly large host-side allocation but maybe we could\n  also maintain that in parallel with the GPU-side scratch buffer.\n\n",
