      "message": "This code in Apply() is called during compute pass execution (RecordComputPass). But we have already added barriers for textures at TransitionUsageNow() before render/compute pass when BeginComputePass. It seems that we don\u0027t need to add barriers for compute again. I removed it, all tests can pass. But if I remove the code for buffer barrier (code snippet from line 146 to 148), tests in ComputeStorageBufferBarrierTests.cpp fail. \n\nComputeStorageBufferBarrierTests were added by Austin, do you think we need to add similar tests for textures in order to call into here and make it take effect? Otherwise, I think we can remove the code snippet.",

      "message": "The barriers are required because in a compute passes you can have multiple dispatches that read and write to the same storage texture, and there must be memory synchronization between them. It is the same reason why buffer tests fail if you remove the barriers for buffers, although we don\u0027t have a test for storage textures.",
