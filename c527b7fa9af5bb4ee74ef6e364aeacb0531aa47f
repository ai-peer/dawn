I was surprised I was able to get breaking patch merged, but upon further investigation we have zero CTS test coverage for external textures - the tests have been disabled for timeout issues.\n\nAdditionally the Pixel_WebGPUImportVideoFrame* tests are having issues when I attempt to re-enable them. The issue does not appear to be with any of my changes, but instead with creation of the frame source.\n\n",
