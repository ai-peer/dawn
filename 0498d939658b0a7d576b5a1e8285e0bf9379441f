      "message": "Hmm, good point. The original focus was to get this working for the CMake build, that was failing on Ubuntu 22.04. However, this change adds `use_sysroot \u003d true` to `.gn`, which means it will attempt to use the sysroot on all GN builds, IIUC. Brian\u0027s original change added DEPS entries for all supported platforms. So I see two options:\n\n1. We do as Brian originally did, and add entries to download sysroot for all supported platforms. This would make GN builds always use the hermetic sysroot everywhere.\n\nor\n\n2. We don\u0027t add `use_sysroot \u003d true` to `.gn`, and add a condition here to only download this for our CMake CI build.\n\nThoughts?",
