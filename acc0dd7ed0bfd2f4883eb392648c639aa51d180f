      "message": "I wonder if it\u0027s necessary to provide this. In the general case, the caller shouldn\u0027t need to know the compression level to iterate over the subresources. Perhaps I\u0027m unclear on what the size_t is. Is it computed flattened subresource index? or is it the plane index / layer index, depending on what compression arg you pass in?\n\nAlso, not sure about the \"decompresses if it needs to\" part. I can see it reasonable to iterate over subresources one-by-one without decompressing the data. We should try to avoid aggressively decompressing if we\u0027re not mutating *all* of the usages. I think we could have a non-const \".at\" method that returns a proxy object. Assigning to that proxy object would compress / decompress the data.",
