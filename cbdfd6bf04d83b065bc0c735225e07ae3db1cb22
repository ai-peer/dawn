      "message": "Similar. This refers to image load/store, while the comment at [1] refers to SSBOs.\n\nI\u0027m trying to find where in the spec it explicitly says that ES does not allow glUniform on storage image bindings. The wiki says:\n\n\"Just as with samplers, image variables reference image unit indices in the context. These are usually set with a binding layout qualifier, but they can also be set with glUniform1i or glProgramUniform1i.\"\n\nIt seems empirically that only the former is allowed in ES (similar to SSBOs), but I can\u0027t find spec language to back it up. There\u0027s no mention of glUniform at all in the desktop GL spec on image load/store.",
