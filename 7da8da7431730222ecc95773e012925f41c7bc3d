      "message": "Hmm, I still think logically, it might make more sense for the `AsyncTask` to own a `Ref\u003cAsyncEvent\u003e` instead of the other way around? I think it could also allow us to get rid of the arguments to `Run` and `RunAsync`?\n\nI\u0027m also not entirely sure why `RunAsync` needed to be static actually... Briefly looking at its usages I think we might be able to just keep it a member? Not sure though.",
