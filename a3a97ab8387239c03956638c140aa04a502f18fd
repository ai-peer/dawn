      "message": "Something the expectation updater now does that the formatter doesn\u0027t is move all the KEEP blocks above non-KEEP blocks. The reason for this is that KEEP blocks cannot be modified (that\u0027s why they\u0027re KEEP), so declaring those expectations first allows the non-KEEP to be modified around the pinned expectations.\n\nMaybe in the future the formatter should do this too.",
