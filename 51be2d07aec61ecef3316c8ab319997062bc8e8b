      "message": "May need to add clamping for the limits, but I have a question about it in https://chat.google.com/room/AAAATWNUeXA/SkkPCYJ_S3A\n\nNow that we have this limit, we can remove the Vulkan backend hacks around [here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/src/dawn/native/vulkan/AdapterVk.cpp;l\u003d388;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d1?q\u003dAdapterVk)\n\nWe could also update the limit discovery code for Metal/D3D12 to report the sum of maxStorageBuffersPerShaderStage + maxStorageTexturesPerShaderStage + maxColorAttachments, but then, we should probably add a test for it that you can actually use all of those.\nCould leave a TODO for now. The test could be tricky if the backend says something like \"you can use 0xFFFFFFFF storage textures\"\n\nalso, two reviewers still the norm for most stuff :)",
