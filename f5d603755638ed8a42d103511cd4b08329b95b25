Another is the results come all at once and get cached all that once so this is the direction I ended up with after a few other dead ends.\n\nHappy to throw it all away if you have some clear other direction I should go.\n\nAlso, if you have any tips for faster iteration. As it is, I end up making some changes and then running it and waiting 2-3 hours for the bots to come back with results.  Maybe --results would fix that but I haven\u0027t gotten a good run yet.",
