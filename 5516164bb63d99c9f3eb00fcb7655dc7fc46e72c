      "message": "This is correct. I was confused looking at this change at first, because I recently wrote CTS tests for u32/i32 modulo, and indeed I wrote them to expect 0 from x % 0. I must have been looking at the Division section of the table in the spec when I implemented this behaviour for const eval. (In my defense, the division and modulo sections in the table are large and exactly the same, except for a few characters).",
