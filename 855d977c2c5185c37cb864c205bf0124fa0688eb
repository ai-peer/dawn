      "message": "I\u0027m wondering if instead of wgpu::CommandBuffer::GetExecutionTime if we should take the callback directly in the CommandEncoderDescriptor (in place of measureExecutionTime). It would simplify things because there would always be exactly one callback, apps wouldn\u0027t be able to request the execution time multiple times.\n\nIn other words, we don\u0027t really need to wait for a GetExecutionTime call to bother asking the server to send the execution time result. If the server sees measureExecutionTime it already knows the client is going to want the result.\n\nThis could be less ergonomic though (as native apps would have to provide a callback very early, instead of being able to attach it later - not a problem for Chromium). IDK if it would be better to put it in CommandBufferDescriptor (in finish()) or keep it as is.",
