I think we should probably reverse the changes made in this CL\nThese changes, and those made in Ben\u0027s CL (https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/79100) have far-reaching effects outside of Dawn\u0027s repo.\n\nBecause Dawn\u0027s BUILD.gn files are reachable from Chromium\u0027s BUILD.gn file, you can now build `libdawn_native` from the root of a *Chromium checkout* by doing: `autoninja -C out/Release native`. And likewise, you\u0027d be able to build Dawn\u0027s unittests by doing `autoninja -C out/Release unittests`. It\u0027s rather amazing that there\u0027s no name conflict, but this is probably not what we want.\n(at least I think this is the case. it could be that my checkout for some reason has some magic sauce)",
