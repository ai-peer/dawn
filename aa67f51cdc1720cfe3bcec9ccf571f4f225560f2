(I ran the tests on that CL)\n\nremoving that lock makes it so that DestroyImpl may be called whenever someone drops a resource on another thread.\n\nI did a find and replace to tag all DestroyImpl with `// CHECK THREADSAFE` so that you can have the context for all of them in the CL.\nI will remove that comment after review.",
