      "message": "I\u0027m running into a D3D12 Debug Layer error on one of my new tests. It turns out to use a shared buffer with CreateConstantBufferView (i.e. wgpu::BufferUsage::Uniform) , then then size must be 256-aligned [1].\n\nIt seems like allowing BufferUsage::Uniform would be desirable. I was thinking we could keep things as they are and only add BufferUsage::Uniform on creation to the WebGPU buffer if the ID3D12Resource does have the correct size alignment. WDYT?\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/src/dawn/native/d3d12/BindGroupD3D12.cpp;l\u003d92",
