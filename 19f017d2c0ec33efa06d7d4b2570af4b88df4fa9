I don\u0027t think that INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES should be included in a bundle because those types of dependencies are intended for the client to include when the relevant functionality is needed. I think the missing absl symbols are because the absl dependency graph is not set up correctly with respect to absl::container_internal::kEmptyGroup",

There\u0027s a comment in abseil\u0027s cmake that suggests `absl::raw_hash_set` is an internal target - https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/container/CMakeLists.txt#L731 and not to depend directly upon it. If it\u0027s internal, why does it export `kEmptyGroup` at https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/container/internal/raw_hash_set.h#L537?",
