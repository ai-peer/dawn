I didn\u0027t see a way to set a default because all it would do is add to the list so, if the list is empty then I grab the default list which includes expectations.txt and compat-expectations.txt and then iterate over them.\n\nAlternatively I could add -compat-expectations and do each one separate. It seem weird tho if you do -expectations foo.txt and it still checks the default for -compat-expectations.\n\nthoughts?",
