      "message": "pass encoders, I don\u0027t think so.\n\nCommandEncoder/CommandBuffer, yes but it might not make a ton of sense for Dawn\u0027s implementation. We have a single \"pending\" command encoder / command buffer that all the commands get shoved into, and we make a new one for each Submit or device.Tick(). So I guess we could label it with a list of all the contained labels from the developer..?",

In the meantime I\u0027m mostly concerned about making sure that the labels appear correctly for developers in error messages, which this change achieves.",
