      "message": "It *might* not be good enough because CopySrc adds flags to the texture allocation in the backend, like VK_ACCESS_TRANSFER_READ_BIT\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/src/dawn_native/vulkan/TextureVk.cpp;l\u003d353?q\u003dTextureVk.cpp\n\nWe should add some basic tests that CopySrc on creation is not needed in src/tests/validation, and tests that the copy actually copies content correctly in src/tests/end2end. The end2end test could make the source buffer with STORAGE usage, and populate it with a compute shader. Could make a new file if you\u0027d like. \n\nIf those tests work, then that\u0027s great! If not, and the backend validation complains, we\u0027ll need to add some internal usages like I prototyped in https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/58140.\n\nThat\u0027s a lot of new stuff for you, so if you\u0027re not comfortable digging into it I can take this over if you\u0027d like. But if you\u0027re interested, I\u0027m happy to help answer questions and work through it with you.",
