      "message": "This is not correct, at least for color attachments. We don\u0027t want to bind to the view\u0027s handle; we always want to render to the base texture; we just use the view to know which layer/mip to render to. This breaks the deferred rendering sample on Compat, for example.\n\nWhat use cases was this change intended to handle?",
