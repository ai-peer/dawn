      "message": "I have to disable the ResolveIntoMultipleResolveTargetsWithShaderOutputMask test on D3D12, because SPIRV-cross doesn\u0027t support SV_Coverage (gl_SampleMask) in HLSL. It would be easy to fix it there except for that the HLSL spec says:\n\nFor SV_Coverage on a pixel shader, OUTPUT is supported on ps_4_1 or higher.\nFor SV_Coverage on a pixel shader, INPUT requires ps_5_0 or higher.\n\nSPIRV-cross currently only keeps the shader module version and the above are shader profile version, so it doesn\u0027t have a way to really check wether there is support for SV_Coverage.",
