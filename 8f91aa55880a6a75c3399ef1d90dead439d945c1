      "message": "This change fixes dawn:573, which was hitting a situation where the depth offset was larger than 0 in the texture copy splitter. When examining these copies that had a depth offset in PIX, they did not copy the expected data. Dawn\u0027s offset calculations seemed correct when I did them by hand - but still they did not result in the correct operation and I am unsure why. Because of this, it seems simplest to workaround the issue by simply not using the depth offset and instead using a larger height offset.",
