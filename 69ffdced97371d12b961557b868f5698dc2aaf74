I think I just figured out why I couldn\u0027t land that change... it\u0027s because this was causing ALL tests to be run on workers because it\u0027s truthy when options.worker was `\u00270\u0027`.\n\nThe actual failures we got are weird, but it explains why the effects were so global.",

It is waiting on Brian\u0027s CL to split the worker tests into separate steps, after which I hope I can land it.\n\nIn particular, I\u0027m pretty sure `use_worker` is dead and should be removed, and `TestWorker` should be deprecated and removed too.\n\nI realized that the code in CTS should be simplified too. I\u0027ll incorporate that in my reland.",
