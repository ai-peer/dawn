It is waiting on Brian\u0027s CL to split the worker tests into separate steps, after which I hope I can land it.\n\nIn particular, I\u0027m pretty sure `use_worker` is dead and should be removed, and `TestWorker` should be deprecated and removed too.\n\nI realized that the code in CTS should be simplified too. I\u0027ll incorporate that in my reland.",
