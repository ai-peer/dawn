Tried to partially fix it in that patch but it quickly ballooned into something that definitely justified it\u0027s own CL. I\u0027d like to get this landed first, as it\u0027s a bit more straightforward, then I can refactor https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/127120 on top of it.\n\nThis is the patch we were discussing on the Dawn reviewers call, Austin.",
