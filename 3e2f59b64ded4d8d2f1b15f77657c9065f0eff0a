      "message": "We need the separate tracking for D3D12 though\n\nI don\u0027t see a nice way to make Merge support this though :-/ something like MergeReduceAspects which would have a different iteration order, a reduce functor and a merge functor...\n\nMaybe we could have the backend initialize the subresource state though. So instead of GetPlaneIndex and GetPlaneCount, the backend provides a lookup table.\n^ also we might need this anyway for stencil only formats. Presumably Stencil is plane index 0, not 1 there.\n\nAlso.. have another Aspect enum that is combined DepthStencil ?",
