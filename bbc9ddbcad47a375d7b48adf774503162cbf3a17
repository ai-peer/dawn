There\u0027s a Read+Write usage conflict with ReadonlyStorage and Storage; or in the others Index and Storage.\n\nMany of these tests are similar, and it would be great if we could factor such that we could pass in a list of buffers to usage as each type and have the bulk of the test body shared.\n\nLike:\n\nDoRWTest({\n  BindingHelper{ IndexBuffer, buffer0 },\n  BindingHelper{ BindGroup, 0, buffer0, Storage, buffer1 ReadonlyStorage },\n  BindingHelper{ BindGroup, 0, buffer1 ReadonlyStorage },\n});\n\nBindingHelper is some helper struct with different constructor args to aid with this,\nkind of like BindingINitialzationHelper\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/dawn/src/utils/WGPUHelpers.h;l\u003d106?originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F",
