      "message": "in general, it would help to be more specific in the comments. There\u0027s a Read+Write usage conflict with ReadonlyStorage and Storage; or in the others Index and Storage.\n\nMany of these tests are similar, and it would be great if we could factor such that we could pass in a list of buffers to usage as each type and have the bulk of the test body shared.\n\nLike:\n\nDoRWTest({\n  BindingHelper{ IndexBuffer, buffer0 },\n  BindingHelper{ BindGroup, 0, buffer0, Storage, buffer1 ReadonlyStorage },\n  BindingHelper{ BindGroup, 0, buffer1 ReadonlyStorage },\n});\n\nBindingHelper is some helper struct with different constructor args to aid with this,\nkind of like BindingINitialzationHelper\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/dawn/src/utils/WGPUHelpers.h;l\u003d106?originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F",

      "message": "That\u0027s true. The tests are quite similar. But the situation is that when I look at all tests I added, there are too many small differences here and there among the tests. So it is not easy to write a template with very few parameters for the majority of tests. \n\nAlternatively I can add helpers as you suggested for bindgroup and bindGroupLayout creation only. But the code snippet for BG and BGL is not long at all in each test. So it may not simplify the code.\n\nAnd I revised the comments to be more specific and informative for each test and deleted duplicated comments as you suggested.",
