LGTM\n\nNote however that for full support of this format we\u0027ll also need to update ExternalTexture to support getting an additional third plane for the alpha. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-webgpu-116/#webcodecs-integration\n\nRelevant files are third_party/dawn/src/dawn/native/ExternalTexture.cpp third_party/dawn/src/tint/lang/wgsl/ast/transform/multiplanar_external_texture.cc and third_party/dawn/src/tint/lang/core/ir/transform/multiplanar_external_texture.cc (we are in the middle of the AST -\u003e IR transition so there is some duplication)",

      "message": "Sure, @Corentin! I am not a WebGPU expert for that part now, just somebody who met the problem and wants to contribute some codes to solve the current problem. I think skia graphite and dawn has a lot work unfinished like implement YV12 and I420 format which also being used on macOS (seems they all broken on Canary if user hit the SkiaGraphite finch experiment). \n\nFor those parts of the content you mentioned, I will need some time to digest, so I will submit another CL to do that part of the job, is that okey with you? for now, the current code could at least make \u003cvideo\u003e element not crash, but indeed we don\u0027t have full support of this format.",
