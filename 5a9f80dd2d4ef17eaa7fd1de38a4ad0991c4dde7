This change allows building with tint_build_msl_writer and/or tint_build_hlsl_writer disabled, whereas previously that would trigger gn errors.\n\nIt also fixes one issue that comes up when disabling tint_build_wgsl_writer, but doesn\u0027t allow you to build with it disabled just yet as there\u0027s a couple of much stickier unittest dependencies that need to be untangled first.",
