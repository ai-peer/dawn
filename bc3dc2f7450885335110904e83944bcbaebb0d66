But turns out switching to R16Float the result will overflow. (Expected is 2098176 here)\nIs there another for for testing the heapSize? maybe not using blend add? Does compute shader also has the same \"heap\" so we can test against that?\n(Added code is for checking float16 texture result against float expected value)",
