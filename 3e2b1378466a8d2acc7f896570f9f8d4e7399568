This is the second attempt.\n\nI removed the third_party/gn/abseil-cpp folder in favour of using the BUILD.gn from third_party/abseil-cpp. This required moving the googletest sources to match chromium as third_party/googlestest/src and copying the third_party/googletest/BUILD.gn from Chromium (which a bunch of edits to make work with dawn/tint).\n\nThis built locally for Dawn standalone with both GN and CMake. I was also able to build `dawn_unittests` in a chromium checkout.",
