      "message": "`UniqueIdentifier` will append suffixes to make sure the name is unique, on symbol collision. As you\u0027re trying to create the unique name in the printer which is the end of the pipeline, this comes after transforms like `SingleEntryPoint`, you might end up with different names between stages for the same variable.\n\nA test that has a symbol collision made by a reference to a variable or structure with the name `blah_ubo_n`, made by just one stage might demonstrate this.\n\nYou might need to create a new transform that runs very early to fix this properly. That transform would have to create a new structure per SSBO.",
