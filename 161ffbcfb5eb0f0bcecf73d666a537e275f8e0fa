Tint now deducts the block name from the variable name. I feel this is not 100% stable, e.g. if Tint changes internal renaming rules of these blocks, mismatch can still happen.\n\nBut would like to hear your thoughts.",

The uniforms within the block must be\ndeclared with the same names, types, and layout qualifiers, in the same order. If a\nprogram contains multiple shaders with different declarations for the same named\nuniform block, the program will fail to link\n\n- `layout(binding \u003d 0, std140) uniform tint_symbol_block_ubo {` in vs and `layout(binding \u003d 1, std140) uniform tint_symbol_block_ubo {` in fs is bad. They are different blocks with the same name (diff inlayout qualifer)\n\n- `layout(binding \u003d 1 std140) uniform tint_symbol_1_block_ubo_1 {` in vs and `layout(binding \u003d 1, std140) uniform tint_symbol_block_ubo_1 {` in fs is ok. They are the same block. The only difference is the block struct name. \"The uniforms **within** the block: names, types and the layout qualifiers\" are the same.\n\nSo what our fix needs to do is to make sure different block have different names, which can be guaranteed by appending the binding number. And it is okay for the same block to have different names as long as their inner variables and layout qualifier are the same.\n\nAnd the current emitter change seems satisfy this need.\n\nLet me know if you still think an early block-renamer transform is needed in this case.",
