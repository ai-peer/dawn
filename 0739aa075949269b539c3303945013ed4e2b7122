      "message": "Yes. I works fine. I just applied this change on top of my patch and tried it.\n\nThe new code can support multiple `{mask, architecture}` pairs, so we can divide each current architecture into smaller pieces with appropriate mask(s) if needed. \n\nA finding: for each vendor, all `{mask, architecture}`\u0027s vendor ids can not overlap. So if there is a workaround/fix aim at a few vendor ids which overlap with but are not exactly the same with current `architecture` in a `{mask, architecture}` pair, I think it is not OK to add an item into the gpu_info.json and we need a hard-coded C++ function for the particular vendor ids, right?",
