As a previously top-level file Kai wasn\u0027t an owner of it.\n\nWorth noting that @cwallez previously asked me to move it to dawn/src (https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/90962/comments/532030c2_8439d979) and *I could have sworn that I did!* But apparently that got lost in a rebase somewhere? In any case, I\u0027ve really actually for-reals-this-time moved it to the right directory in the latest patch so we won\u0027t have this problem again.",
