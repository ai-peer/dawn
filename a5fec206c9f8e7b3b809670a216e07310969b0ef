      "message": "Thanks for the comment. Yes, I think such a test sounds like useful. But I don\u0027t think the current this test behaves so. It releases buffer before the first map callback is fired. I have removed this test because it sounds like duplicated with the new test.\n\nI reverted the test and edited a bit to test it.",
