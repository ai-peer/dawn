      "message": "All changes made for Adapter feature management is based on the following idea:\n1. Whether a feature is supported is based on two factor:\n    a) the system/backend/driver etc. actually support the feature, and\n    b) the toggles allows using this feature (namely *\"the restriction of toggles\"*);\n  \u003e For example: a) `shader-f16` on Windows require DXC of some version existed, this is a fact that not related to toggles; b) `shader-f16` feature require `DisallowUnsafeAPIs` toggle disabled on all backend, and require `UseDXC` toggle on Windows for using DXC.\n\n2. Device toggles state can be different from aevice toggles state on those toggles that controls the support of features (i.e. `DisallowUnsafeAPIs` and `UseDXC`), due to the toggles overriding. We want this to happen so we can create a internal unsafe device from a safe adapter an so on.\n3. Adapter has to report the features it support based on adapter toggles state (that\u0027s the only toggles state it can see), while we want to validate the required features with required device toggles when creating device. The reasons including:\n    1. In this way we can create a unsafe device with more experimental features from a safe adapter for e.g. internal use or testing propose.\n    2. On the other hand Chrome (JS) user won\u0027t be able to create such a device with features that adapter not report supporting, since *we decided to use same toggles requirement for both Instance, Adapters and Devices in Chrome by default*. Internal usage can have specially constructed toggles requirement, but not user\u0027s.\n\nWith these ideas, I distinguished the concept of \"unfiltered supported features\" and \"filtered supported features with given toggles\" in adapters. The first is the features that can actually supported by system/backend/driver, and the second one is the subset of the first one that only contains features allowed by some toggles state, adapter toggles state or device toggles state in different places.",

      "message": "This function is used in End-to-End testing. The propose of this function is to answer **\"Can I require the shader-f16 feature for testing, if I enable UseDXC toggle when creating device, although it is disabled in the adapter because other test cases doesn\u0027t want it?\"**.\n\nIn end-to-end testing, Instance get reused for every testcases, so its toggles and adapters\u0027 toggles it create are also the same for each test cases. This works well for `DisallowUnsafeAPIs` because we usually want to disable it, but it cause trouble for `UseDXC`. Currently major test cases tests FXC instead of DXC and has `UseDXC` disabled, while we still want to test `UseDXC` for features like `shader-f16` on Windows in some test cases.\n\nTherefore, we can not enable `UseDXC` by default for instance and hence adapters, otherwise we can not test the FXC cases (all cases will just run for DXC). In this case, adapter will always report **not supporting shader-f16**, but actually it **can** support if we enable `UseDXC` in device toggles. This function solve this problem.",

You point out that this would be simpler if we had an adapter toggle instead. So in my perspective:\n - IIUC, adapter toggle is preferred but too much refactoring right now\n - which means in the end state, instance toggles (probably?) aren\u0027t needed that much. The same thing can be achieved with defaults for the adapter toggles, or by passing more stuff in the adapter toggles descriptor\n - but we still want a way to have use_dxc and shader-f16 useable in a consistent way\n \nIf eventually we have adapter toggles, I\u0027m thinking that we can have a simpler short-term solution just to make use_dxc and shader-f16 work nicely. I\u0027m worried that the current solution is a lot of code to add instance toggles and this unfiltered/filtered-but-actually-available distinction - which won\u0027t be needed if we have adapter toggles.\n\nAn alternative could be to add a simple way to temporarily set toggles on the adapter at the dawn::native level since we only need to have the toggles impact feature-checking and requestDevice (toggle inheritance and feature validation).\n\n - DawnTestBase::SupportsFeatures before checking features manually sets toggles:\n   ```\n   mBackendAdapter.SetToggles({ \"use_dxc\" });\n   dawn::native::GetProcs().adapterEnumerateFeatures(...);\n   mBackendAdapter.ClearToggles();\n   ```\n - DawnTestBase::CreateDeviceImpl before creating the device manually sets toggles:\n   ```\n   mBackendAdapter.SetToggles({ \"use_dxc\" });\n   WGPUDevice device \u003d mBackendAdapter.CreateDevice(...);\n   mBackendAdapter.ClearToggles();\n   ```\n - webgpu_decoder_impl.cc does similar stuff for WebGPU",

This is the concept \"features supported under device toggles\".\n\nWhat this CL trying to do is making Adapter only report supported features under the restriction of adapter toggles, so this introduce the concept \"features supported under adapter toggles\".\n\nActually it is a possible to handle \"shader-f16\" features and \"use_dxc\" toggle in webgpu_decoder_impl.cc, just filter it if use d3d12 backend and \"use_dxc\" toggle is not enabled.

But there are more complexity of implementing adapter toggles (thus of the same backend), specifically of managing multiple adapters that only different in required toggles within a single instance. Maybe it would be clearer to do that in a separate CL, and downgrade UseDXC with that.",
