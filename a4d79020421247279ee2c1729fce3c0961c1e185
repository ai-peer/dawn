I\u0027m thinking that we can start just with what\u0027s needed for buffer to buffer copies, then expand to buffer to texture and texture to buffer copies, etc. This code is a lot more interesting than all the state setup since it actually executes work on the GPU.\n\nThat way we can also incrementally enable the tests and verify it works",
