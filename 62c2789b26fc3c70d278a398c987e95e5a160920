      "message": "PTAL. Thanks!\n\nLMK if TextureState::OwnedInternal makes sense for the texture created from\nglEGLImageTargetTexture2DOES(). I mean, the texture object is owned by the Dawn backend,\nbut the contents are not. Not sure of the semantics.\n\nNote that I tried validating that the EGLImage\u0027s format matched the WGPU texture format.\nHowever, after a GL texture has been \"laundered\" through an EGLImage and extracted on the other\nside, the glGetTexParameter call with GL_TEXTURE_INTERNAL_FORMAT returns different results \nbetween ANGLE and native GLES drivers. One returns GL_RGBA8, the other GL_RGBA.\n",
