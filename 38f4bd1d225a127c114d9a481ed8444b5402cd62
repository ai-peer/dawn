I don\u0027t think we need all the extra casts - the issue is that unsigned long long and unsigned long are not the same type which is why you had ambiguous overload errors. On some platforms size_t is unsigned long and on some it is unsigned long long\n\nSo we could just define all three overloads and I think it should be okay.\nBut also, in Release builds, this function is literally just two instructions, maybe have a template in the header and inline it?",
