For the 7x7 Google meet sample(https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:content/test/data/gpu/vc/webgpu_videos_mxn.html;l\u003d1?q\u003dwebgpu_videos\u0026sq\u003d\u0026ss\u003dchromium), the GPU usage can drop from 35% to 21% on my ADL ChromeOS device. I would really appreciate your perspective on this, Thanks!",
