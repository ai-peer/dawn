      "message": "Thank you for this fix.\nI\u0027m in the process of reviewing and landing my mega-stack of CLs to support shader creation-time expressions (const-expr).\n\nI suspect that my changes would also fix this. Would you be happy to wait until my changes have landed (ETA mid next week) and then we can re-access whether this change is necessary?",

      "message": "Thanks for your reply! There is another patch (94533) adding end-to-end tests for single-scalar matrix constructor, please let me know what do you think about it too, thanks.\nI have another concern, that currently in WGSL spec it seems not having a single-scalar constructor for matrix (if I get it right), though I think it should be helpful and we already implement it in Tint, so should I raise this issue in WGSL spec\u0027s github or WG meeting?",
