      "message": "The short answer is: we use Dawn to develop the WebGPU backend for our in-house 3D engine (since the tooling with Emscripten isn\u0027t at the same level as with native desktop); same with ANGLE, to get a better insight into WebGL.\n\nLong answer: it\u0027s not possible to use the Dawn libs built with Clang with VS due to the C++ API exposing things like std::vector, e.g.:\n\nstd::vector\u003cdawn_native::Adapter\u003e adapters \u003d instance.GetAdapters();\n\n(From memory, down to std::vector mapping to a different internal namespace, not just the different memory layout between Clang and VS\u0027s STL.)\n\nTo work around this we\u0027d need to either build everything with Clang, which for Windows feels a bit second class, add a layer to expose a C API (just for the parts that need/expose STL), or build Dawn with VS. When we first started experimenting (2019) Dawn would build with VS with no problems, but at some point the win-msvc-rel-x64 builder seems to have stopped running and more bits started breaking.\n\nThe fixes for the tests was out of completion, all the other fixes were just to get the dawn_samples and the libs building. Getting the optimised build working (at all) is the only step remaining (then the MSVC builders should run again).",

      "message": "Thanks for the info. Clang for windows wrks pretty great (it builds Chromium) and should be a drop-in replacement with clang-cl but I understand that\u0027s quite a big change.\n\nLooking at the win-msvc-rel-x64 builder, it seems we could fix it by removing use_goma, I\u0027ll take a look at doing that, and if we can get it green then I think it would be worth putting it on the CQ so it doesn\u0027t break again.",
