I\u0027m hoping that won\u0027t be needed very often. And, it communicates data with a .json object so we should be able to extend it relatively easily.\n\nany opinions on directories / naming? bclayton@ in particular since you\u0027re also adding go scripts somewhere.\n\n[dawn_root]/third_party/gn/webgpu-cts is where GN-related things to compile just the CTS lives\n[dawn_root]/webgpu-cts is where the rest of the support code lives. Either for generating lists of stuff for GN, or for Telemetry.",
