The depth attachment needs to be at least the size of the color attachment.\n\nWith this understanding, I believe Vulkan would allow you to use a smaller DS attachment when rendering the uv planes right? So is it the intention of this change to require all backend APIs to use a larger DS than necessary just because D3D11 requires it to be at least the size of the full texture (i.e. size of plane 0)?",
