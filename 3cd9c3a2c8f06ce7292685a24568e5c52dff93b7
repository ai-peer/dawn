The overrides are already gone by the time any of our internal transforms are run.\n\nI can trigger this with a unit test for the `ModuleScopeVarToEntryPointParamTest` transform, though I do have to disable another validation error we hit if overrides are not removed beforehand. So clearly we are relying on overrides being removed for multiple reasons at the moment.",
