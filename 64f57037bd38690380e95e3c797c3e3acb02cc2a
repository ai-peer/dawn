      "message": "see the test SetUp in this patch for how we can override requestAdapter and requestDevice in Chromium.\n\nI\u0027m thinking however it might be a good idea to have the wire server add a chained struct to the RequestAdapterOptions or DeviceDescriptor with a pointer to itself. This would make it significantly easier to get a pointer to the current webgpu decoder instead of:\n - the static hack I\u0027m doing here - though it would indeed work in Chrome.\n - make some \"fake\" WGPUInstance and WGPUAdapter objects that we proxy commands through and store a back reference to the decoder.",
