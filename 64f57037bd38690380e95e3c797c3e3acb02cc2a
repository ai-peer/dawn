      "message": "For the tests yea we can do that, though at the time I didn\u0027t implement GetProperties and the stuff in this patch stack is a bit out of order.\n\nIn Chromium we\u0027ll have to override this because we can\u0027t directly give the Renderer whatever is requests. Do you think something like this would work?\n\nIn the other comment:\n\nI\u0027m thinking however it might be a good idea to have the wire server add a chained struct to the RequestAdapterOptions or DeviceDescriptor with a pointer to itself.
