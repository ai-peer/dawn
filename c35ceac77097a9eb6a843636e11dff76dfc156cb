      "message": "Ohh, right. Kinda had the C pattern in my head where ChainedStruct is a member and not a base class. Too bad.\n\nThough... if ChainedStruct _were_ a member instead of a base class, would it have the same layout as the C struct, so reinterpret casts would be safe(r) for chain structs? Right now it looks like we are actually assuming they are safe - we assert the members line up, but don\u0027t assert anything about sType and nextInChain?:\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:out/webview-Debug/gen/third_party/dawn/include/dawn/webgpu_cpp.h;l\u003d3408;drc\u003da0253e388931252decd5b6bc6fa098b06c03a95a\n\n(I also noticed we call it .nextInChain in C++ but .next in C for some reason)",
