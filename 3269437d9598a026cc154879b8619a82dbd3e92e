Thus, we can store it on the STMContents.\n\n(Note that STMContents doesn\u0027t exist anymore. Only the base class SharedResourceMemoryContents, but you can re-introduce STMContents)\n\nSharedResourceMemory::CreateContents is virtual for this reason. The subclasses can generate their own contents objects.",
