I tried just making a change to the dawn.json instead, but found that I needed to serialize the tick cmd on the wire client to keep some Chrome tests working. I couldn\u0027t figure out how to get the DeviceTickCmd struct to autogen, so just went with adding an entry point. Happy to revise it to the dawn.json way if preferred.\n\n",
