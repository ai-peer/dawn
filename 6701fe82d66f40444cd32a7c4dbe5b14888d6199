It\u0027s duplicated the code into each of the case blocks, `texture_expr`, `texture_sem` and other bits seem to be the same over all blocks? The `type` seems to be declared uninitialized at 1082, and used in the lambda, so if a blocks forgets to set it, we\u0027ll end up using an uninitialized value.",
