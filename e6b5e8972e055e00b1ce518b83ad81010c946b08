      "message": "Alternatively, texture subresource tracking information can be put into PassResourceUsage. But resource usage in compute pass is per each dispatch, not per pass. So I\u0027d like to put it here. And I can add code to set/track/reset subresource tracking info via functions above in dispatch() for compute pass later. \n\nPrevious code of textureUsage for each texture in PassResourceUsage can be seen as a fast path when there is no multiple write or read/write in a pass.",
