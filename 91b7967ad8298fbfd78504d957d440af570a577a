      "message": "Without this CL there is a crash in the mentioned end2end test on the latest Intel Windows Vulkan driver because in this function there is no code to handle VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR as the return value of vkQueuePresentKHR.\n\nThere are potentially two ways to fix the crash:\n1.  case VK_SUCCESS:\n    case VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR:\n                return {};\n\nThe performance will not be the best as the swapchain no longer matches the surface properties.\n\n\n2. What I am doing in this CL.\nBy recreating the swapchain the swapchain will match the surface properties and can have better performance than 1.",

      "message": "Ah thanks for the explanation, I didn\u0027t realize SUBOPTIMAL was unhandled and went to the default: case.\n\nI think we should bundle SUBOPTIMAL with SUCCESS because the driver is likely doing a blit too, which it would know how to do more efficiently. Also in the future I think there will be a \"suboptimal\" signal going to the application so it knows it should resize but we wouldn\u0027t be doing it on its behalf.",
