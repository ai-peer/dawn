      "message": "They\u0027re marked as SKIP in main. See diff of base vs. PS8: they\u0027re now unmodified.\n\nHere\u0027s the sad saga: in patchset 6, I rebased with --generate-expected, and those got regenerated as now-passing. The Kokoro run failed because it thinks they\u0027re still failing.\n\nEventually I diagnosed it to a bad validation.cache on my local machine which considered the hash of the passing result as skipped. Removed it, rebased, and the tests went back to failing as expected (files reverted).",
