      "message": "I know, but when I used this, I found that the CTS runner and my tooling were disagreeing about classification - possibly because of the interval measured.\n\nThe results also become *very* messy if we reduce this much further. As we have so many tests over the 5 second mark, the test reduction becomes a RNG when this is small.\n\nI\u0027d like to keep this as-is, and reduce once we\u0027ve got the test times under control.",
