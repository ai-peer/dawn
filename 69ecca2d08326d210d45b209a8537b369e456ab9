      "message": "@bclayton@google.com Apologies as I\u0027ve forgotten the answer to this _again_, but under what circumstances will the roller remove RetryOnFailure expectations? Does it happen if they didn\u0027t run at all?\n\nThe automated expectation remover \"pared down\" these lines by adding extra tags. I am wondering if that behavior is colliding with some behavior of this roller.",

The tool effectively deletes all these expectations and rebuilds these chunks with the non-passing results that haven\u0027t been covered by previous expectations.\n\nThe intention was that this only included new flakes / failures that were to be triaged by the gardener and placed into a chunk with a bug ID and description.",
