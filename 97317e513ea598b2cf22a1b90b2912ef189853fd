      "message": "Hello again.\n\nThis is a small change to enable precompiled headers for the `tint` and `dawn_native` projects.\n\nWith this small change, I get a 1.5x compilation speed improvement in my case for dawn_native (from ~20 to ~12sec), and a 2.5x one for tint (from ~50 to ~20sec).\n\nThere are more gains to be had (at least very small ones with a similar change for Vulkan and D3D12 common headers, for example, but might be others) but I wanted to keep things simple, as at this point it\u0027s not really noticeable (although it really depends on the computer).",
