      "message": "If we add this, we should add an end2end test that such creation works.\nOn Metal, you cannot simply create a texture of format  wgpu::TextureFormat::R8BG8Biplanar420Unorm. You can emulate it by making an IOSurface with that format, then wrapping it. Not sure about other backends.\n\nPerhaps this ought to be a feature that we query support for.\n\nIf we can\u0027t support creation everywhere, an alternative could be to make two separate textures one for each plane - so long as we\u0027re able to copy/blit those planes into the real backing afterward (adding rendering + copy support is a separate issue).",
