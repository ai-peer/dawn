      "message": "Maybe this could be a constant in DynamicUploader itself. Eventually we won\u0027t need to deal with this value because the allocations for staging buffers will use the backend\u0027s memory allocator to suballocate in a heap.\n\nWe could also create the DynamicUploader on device creation (even if it ends up never being used) which would allow removing the ResultOrError for GetDynamicUploader. (and the dynamic uploader just creates the first staging buffer lazily maybe?)",
