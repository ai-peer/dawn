Now it can pass all tests on my local machine (10K+ subtests). \n\nI will re-org the tests on my local machine and submit a follow-up patch. The current one spend about one hour when running all 10K+ subtests. It is too long and unacceptable. I will cover all parameters but limit the time to ~60 seconds in the follow-up patch.\n\nPTAL. Thanks!",
