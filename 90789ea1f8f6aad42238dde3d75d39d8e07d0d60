The errors can be seen in the CI build log: https://source.cloud.google.com/results/invocations/a7e91050-2784-4a0c-b930-592c44835a22/targets/dawn%2Fwindows%2Fcmake-msvc2019-release%2Fpresubmit/log\nMSVC complains about the implicit conversions from an enum type to std::variant\u003cuint32_t, std::string\u003e when initializing OperandList from an initializer_list. Can be solved by doing explicit conversion.\n\nIf I fix those, there is a warning (treated as an error) about stage being potentially uninitialized in EmitEntryPoint.",
