      "message": "Please take a look, thanks!\n\nThis CL now mainly serve as a step of implementing adapter toggles, as the `shader-f16` feature is now exposed in Chrome as expected with `UseDXC` checked in Chrome (thanks for Austin\u0027s help). This CL add the concept of `allowed features under the restriction of adapter\u0027s toggles` (to properly handle the feature query in adapters) and `allowed features under the restriction of required device\u0027s toggles` (to allow device toggles override adapter toggles when creating devices).\n\n`UseDXC` may be downgraded as an adapter toggle after implemented, but now it is promoted as an instance toggle, only to get inherited to adapters because currently we don\u0027t have a method to require adapter toggles.",
