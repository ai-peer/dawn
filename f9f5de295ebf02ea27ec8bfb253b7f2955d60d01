      "message": "I (still) might prefer the client to be passed in as an arg here. Mostly because I think that allocation of the objects shouldn\u0027t need to concern itself with needing to call client-\u003eTrackObject. Track/Untrack isn\u0027t a feature of the allocator, it\u0027s a layer added by the client to ensure everything gets promptly deallocated when the client goes away.\n\nHowever, most code won\u0027t need to explicitly pass Client* if we have a wrapper Client::Make around ObjectAllocator::Make that can pass the client, and then take care of calling Track",
