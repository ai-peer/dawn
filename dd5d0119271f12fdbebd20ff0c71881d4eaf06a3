      "message": "Reading TSAN log, the problem is in ~Surface, especially where I do this:\n\n```\nmRecycledSwapChain-\u003eAPIRelease();\nmRecycledSwapChain \u003d nullptr;\n```\n\nThe \"\u003d nullptr\" line triggers the error and so I realize it does a little more than I thought. Is it because mRecycledSwapChain  being a Ref, setting it to nullptr automatically calls APIRelease on the objects it references, so that these two lines are redundant? Or is it that there is a different way than \"\u003d nullptr\" to reset the Ref to something that does not point to any valid value?\n\n\nPS: Austin, I think the line you suggested to add TSAN to tests did not work: \"builder \"chromium/try/dawn-try-linux-tsan-rel\" is included but not defined in the LUCI project\"",
