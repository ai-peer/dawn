I wonder if eventually we will want this to be configurable though.\n\nCurrently, Chrome already does PerformPollingWork(); explicitly after handling commands - which calls ProcessEvents on the instance it cares about.\n\nIn practice, this means we might do another no-op ProcessEvents after handling WebGPU commands which is fine for now IMO. Ideally we only do it once in the future.",
