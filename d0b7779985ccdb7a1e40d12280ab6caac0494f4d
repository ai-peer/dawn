      "message": "1) yea it\u0027s not but I think it\u0027s more clear this way.\n2) For JS, it doesn\u0027t matter, for native it does. if you release the last reference to the fence inside the callback, because we didn\u0027t remove it, it would get called again. We have some wire unit tests for this and for buffer mapping. I can add a comment about it.",
