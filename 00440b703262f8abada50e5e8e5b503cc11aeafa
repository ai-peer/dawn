Kept this change separate because I wanted to be able to discuss it more easily.\n\nThis change works, in that it satisfies the Vulkan debug layer. The actual copies are still failing, but that seems to be a more universal issue with Vulkan and stencil copies. Doesn\u0027t feel like a very clean way of doing it, but the other approaches that I tried all ended up trying to stuff metadata into Format (like baseAspects) that simply didn\u0027t apply anywhere else and felt very awkward to maintain.\n\nOpinions on a preferred approach here would be appreciated!",
