      "message": "Looking at the Vulkan implementation, it appears the problem is that if the usage isn\u0027t directly supported by the swapchain, we do a blit. That blit doesn\u0027t always work because the blit need TRANSFER_DST. So then in that case we need to use a shader to do the blit.\n\nSo it looks like it will all be possible on Vulkan - but do we want to do the blits?\nAn alternative here could be to expose a way to query what WGPUUsages the WGPUSurface supports - then the embedder has full control about doing blits before presentation.",
