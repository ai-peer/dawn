      "message": "My understanding is that the heap will still be inserted at the end of the LRU cache. Since we check resources one by one when trying to evict, if any newer resource is before that heap in the LRU, then we won\u0027t see it. So I don\u0027t think this CL will work in real use cases (vs. a synthetic test that would only create placed resources).",
