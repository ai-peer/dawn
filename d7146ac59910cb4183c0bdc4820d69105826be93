      "message": "I have some concern that the refcounting is not symmetric between the two paths. Things would be clearer like the following:\n\n  BindGroupLayout* bgl \u003d nullptr\n  if (mLayout-\u003eGetBindGroupLayoutsMask()[..]) {\n    bgl \u003d mLayout-\u003e ...\n  } else {\n     if (GetDevice()-\u003eConsumedError(GetDevice()-\u003eGetOrCreateEmptyBindGroupLayout(), \u0026bgl) {\n       return ..\n     }\n  }\n\n  // Semantically a new object is returned so increase the reference count.\n  bgl-\u003eReference();\n  return bgl;\n\nThen the refcount at [1] disappears.\n\nAlso what do you think of creating the empty bindgroup in all cases in DeviceBase::Initialize?",

      "message": "This part wasn\u0027t symmetric even in the version without caching. That\u0027s because Device::GetOrCreateBindGroup is increasing refcount on its own, while PipelineLayoutBase::GetBindGroupLayout is not, so the two cases need to be handled differently. The new function Device::GetOrCreateEmptyBindGroup is using Device::GetOrCreateBindGroup when run for the first time, so this is still the case.\n\nI could modify it to create the empty bind group layout during initialization and then remove the refcount at [1], so that could then be written in the way you proposed, but that would make Device::GetOrCreateBindGroup and Device::GetOrCreateEmptyBindGroup produce different behaviour when it comes to increasing refcount.",

      "message": "Gotcha, I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s a better way to name GetOrCreateBGL to express it is more like creation in that it returns a new Ref. Maybe it could return ResultOrError\u003cRef\u003cBindGroupLayoutBase\u003e\u003e. We recently had an optimization that will make this the same cost as ResultOrError\u003cBindGroupLayoutBase*\u003e. It doesn\u0027t need to be done in this CL and could be a follow-up.\n\nEither option, keeping the code as is + follow-up or creating the empty bind group on device initialization (+ follow-up) would work.",
