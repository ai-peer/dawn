      "message": "I had the inverted reference release in my first version of the patch and a test for it so that\u0027s why I changed the this line. In the end I don\u0027t think the order matters for the copy constructor: the only problem is when you copy do A \u003d B when they both have the same mHandle and in that case we don\u0027t have an issue because B\u0027s reference keeps the object alive.\n\nDoes that sound good?",
