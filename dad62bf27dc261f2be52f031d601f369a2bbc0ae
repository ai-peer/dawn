      "message": "This is subtle.\n\n`@offset` is printed as a comment, as the WGSL is still actually correct if you drop it - as the WGSL writer is also emitting the padding. We also have code paths from SPIR-V reader to WGSL writer, where the attribute is preserved.\n\nThe `@stride` attribute *needs* to be there, as it would otherwise be information that\u0027s just lost. Yes, it can\u0027t be parsed, but if you were to comment it out, you\u0027d still have a different program. The idea for these types of attributes is that you don\u0027t have a code path where we\u0027d print them in production builds. They\u0027re internal-only information.",
