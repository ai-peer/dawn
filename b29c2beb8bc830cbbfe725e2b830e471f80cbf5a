      "message": "We probably don\u0027t ~need~ to support Vulkan 1.0 ICD, but Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 are basically collections of promoted extensions. So if a Vulkan 1.0 ICD supports all the extensions we care about, then we can use it.\n\nNote that the problem in this comment is stated for a 1.0 vs 1.1 mismatch but could happen for other mismatches too. Finally it is removed at the top of this patch stack.",
