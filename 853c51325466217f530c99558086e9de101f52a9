      "message": "PTAL. You\u0027ll see that I was unable to implement a backend label for ShaderModuleD3D12, because the backend object is just a struct and cannot accept a name. Additionally, I did not implement the SetLabel mechanism for ShaderModuleVk due to the shader caching mechanism - it seems like in order to make this work we\u0027d somehow need to know the pipelineLayout and entry point to acquire the correct cache key to retrieve the underlying object.",
