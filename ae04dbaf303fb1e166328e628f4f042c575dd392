      "message": "When adding new capabilities we always gate them first behind the AllowUnsafeAPIs toggle so 1) we don\u0027t ship feature before they are fully tested 2) we control when the feature becomes visible to developers and attackers.\n\nThis would involve adding a check using that Toggle here similar to [1] and a tiny test in [2]. I think for this feature we\u0027d like to at least have a few CTS tests before launching it, just to test that hardware support actually works.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/src/dawn/native/CommandEncoder.cpp;drc\u003dc0265133106c7647e90f9aaa4377d28190b1a6a9;l\u003d2200\n[2] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/src/dawn/tests/unittests/validation/UnsafeAPIValidationTests.cpp",
