However, this is kind of a confusing way to achieve that, and in fact might be wrong: I think because of this if(), if an error scope already had an error on it, that would take precedence over an Unknown/DeviceLost and the error scope would resolve instead of reject.\n\nCould we just never pass Unknown/DeviceLost into this function (and ASSERT that) and have a separate method to reject all the error scopes at once?",
