      "message": "The actual implementation looks good to me.\n\nI have a concern about the high-level design. Limiting items in a Set to only valid Key types, feels unintuitive and leaking the implementation details. Atleast in my mental model, I would have expected any valid value for a Map would be a valid value for Set.\n\nI understand that realistically this would require either a generic hashing mechanism to generate keys for the set or using a bespoke internal implementation, which is probably more work than justified.\nI think atleast the comments/documentation around Set should be very explicit about this limitation.",
