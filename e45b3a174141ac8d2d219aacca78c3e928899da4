The Vulkan backend also doesn\u0027t wait for the pending commands.\n\nNote: I see that Kai commented the opposite here. We should probably leave a comment in the code so that it\u0027s clear why we need to forget commands in WaitForIdleForDestruction. Since we\u0027re waiting for destruction, it seems fine to forget everything currently flight.",
