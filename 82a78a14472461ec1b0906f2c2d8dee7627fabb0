      "message": "Thank you for the fix Aleksi - just to confirm; is this failure reproducible in Dawn\u0027s current dawn_end2end_tests, or did you need to test in Chrome?\n\nWould be great to have a test if there isn\u0027t one that would have failed already.\n\nAdding `-Wshorten-64-to-32` to `internal_config` in `dawn/src/dawn/common/BUILD.gn` we have a TON of truncation errors. Ideally we might even want to add all of `-Wconversion`. No need to do that in this CL though.\n\nFor indirect-stuff, I believe we also have a bug in https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/dawn/src/dawn/native/IndirectDrawMetadata.cpp;l\u003d28?q\u003dComputeMaxIndirectValidationBatchOffsetRange\u0026sq\u003d which would be great to address in this CL as well.\n",
