If you don\u0027t mind, I made one significant late change that only got posted after your review was done: I changed the OwnedCompilationMessages on the ShaderModule to be a unique_ptr. That doesn\u0027t really benefit (or hurt) this CL, but looking ahead to the next CL I post it\u0027ll be important for ShaderModules to be able to consume a list of messages produced from validation, so this pattern makes more sense. If you don\u0027t mind taking one last look to sanity check that I\u0027d appreciate it!",
