      "message": "I had to change this in an earlier draft where I was overloading operator\u0026 (address of) similar to how ComPtr works. Overloading operator\u0026 is not permitted by the style guide and enforced by cpplint to prevent subtle issues with generic code so I changed it to an explicit method (GetMut). However, I kept this part of the change since the previous implementation seems wrong since it behaves more like swap than a destructive move-assignment, although it might work in practice because rhs is often destroyed soon after the move-assignment.",
