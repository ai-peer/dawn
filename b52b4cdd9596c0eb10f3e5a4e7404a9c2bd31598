It\u0027ll happen if/when we serialize WGSL input.\n\nIt is fine as long as there is something else that tells you how long a string is supposed to be. It could be another numerical field before the string field - or we could change the format to prefix the string with its length.\n\n{len0:7,0:\\\"string0\\\",len1:7,1:\\\"string1\\\"}\n{0:7\\\"string0\\\",1:7\\\"string1\\\"}\n\nI still kinda think this might become a binary format in the future in which case the length will also have to become part of the format.",
