This causes issues on Windows, because no object is produced.\n\nSee https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/gn-dev/c/Jn4TbhOtB9k\n```\n  * Source sets can have no sources, while static libraries will give strange\n    platform-specific errors if they have no sources. If a target has only\n    headers (for include checking purposes) or conditionally has no sources on\n    sone platforms, use a source set.\n```",
