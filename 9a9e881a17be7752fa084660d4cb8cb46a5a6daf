      "message": "I don\u0027t think this math is correct. Since we can\u0027t use gl_NumWorkGroups it might be best to use a 1x1 texture as Corentin suggested instead of kSize x kSize texture.\n\nThe reason this is passing the tests is because bufferTex is also getting lazy cleared. I apologize and should have noticed this earlier, but we should first do an explicit copy to bufferTex to clear it to non-zero. Then, we should sample the texture and copy into the buffer.",
