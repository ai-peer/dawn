      "message": "I don\u0027t think this math is correct. Since we can\u0027t use gl_NumWorkGroups it might be best to use a 1x1 texture as Corentin suggested instead of kSize x kSize texture.\n\nThe reason this is passing the tests is because bufferTex is also getting lazy cleared. I apologize and should have noticed this earlier, but we should first do an explicit copy to bufferTex to clear it to non-zero. Then, we should sample the texture and copy into the buffer.",

I don\u0027t think his comment was correct because right now we\u0027re using the compute shader to copy from an uninitialized texture to an uninitialized buffer.\n\nBoth will be lazy cleared so we can\u0027t tell if the clear is happening in the texture.\nWe can wait to see what cwallez@ thinks so you don\u0027t undo too much work.",
