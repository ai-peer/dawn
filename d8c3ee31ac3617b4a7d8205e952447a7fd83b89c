The reason why we have a bunch of this metadata with API and prefixes etc is because at some point we thought a second project would use the same set of generator (for WebNN) so we started making the templates not reference WebGPU or Dawn directly. But IMHO we should undo it, and not add metadata like this for new things like the Kotlin bindings.",

Might be worth having a TODO with a new issue explaining that we\u0027ll have to redo asynchrony (and figure out the ergonomics as well)\n\nNote also that IIRC in dawn.json there is one length argument (or structure member?) that\u0027s used for two different arguments. I think it will cause a lot of problems and we should change dawn.json + validate it out when parsing the model.",
