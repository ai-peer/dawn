      "message": "Still not sold on this idea. This means we\u0027ll be blocking fuzzing targets if earlier targets have bugs. Which means that anything later in the stack will end u getting fuzzed less then the stuff at the beginning as the earlier items trigger crashes.\n\nIt seems like this would be better as a general main and a simple way to combine that with a cc file in the cmake/gn files to generate each fuzz executable.\n\nIt would also mean you can run a fuzzer in isolation without having to run all the other fuzzers as well.",
