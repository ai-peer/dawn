      "message": "It\u0027s only called in the Inspector for entry point functions (there\u0027s a check at the top of the function you linked to which makes sure of that). For an entry point function, the entries will still always be `sem::GlobalVariable` with this change.\n\nWe were already adding `sem::Parameter` entries to `TextureSamplerPairs` for non-entry-point functions before this change, it\u0027s just that sometimes they were the /wrong/ `sem::Parameter`. This change fixes that.",
