      "message": "\u003e no header providing \"dawn::native::SortAdapters\" is directly included (https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/misc/include-cleaner.html)\n\u003e \n\u003e (Lint observed on `android-clang-tidy-rel` and `linux-clang-tidy-rel`)\n\nInstance.h includes Adapter.h, which has SortAdapters. Is the convention that we should include Adapter.cpp file too?\n\nSince Instance.h only needs the forward declaration, I tried moving the include to Instance.cpp, but then found there are a lot of other files that currently depend on Instance.h including Adapter.h. If preferred, I can go include Adapter.h in all the other files that need it and omit it from Instance.h (either in this change or a followup change)",
