      "message": "The way the roller updates expectations is to walk the expectation lines from top to bottom.\nFor each of the expectations in a non-`KEEP` block, it\u0027ll gather all the results under that **query** (excluding tags) and then try to rebuild the expectation lines from that. This means it has the ability to split course-grain expectations as things get fixed, and to simplify the tags to what it believes the failures actually cover.\nThis approach has the consequence that a single input expectation can be transformed into multiple expectations.",
