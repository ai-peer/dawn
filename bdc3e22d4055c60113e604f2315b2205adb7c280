      "message": "As I understand it, the output of the FirstOffsetInfo transform is needed to set up the root signature for a draw call. Because of this, we either need to:\n\n- Unconditionally run the transform on the Tint program\n- Serialize the first offset info and store it in the pipeline cache (which is probably possible once https://crbug.com/dawn/549 is resolved?)\n- Avoid the need for the first offset info output\n\nIn this CL I\u0027ve opted for the latter, buf am open to other options.\n\nEdit: enga@ below suggested the first option, which I will give a shot to.",
