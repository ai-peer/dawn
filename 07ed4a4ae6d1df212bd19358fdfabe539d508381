      "message": "This tick function invokes callbacks. We should have some way to ensure that it isn\u0027t called by an internal thread but only as a result of the public API calling Tick(). The reason is we only want callbacks to happen when the developer calls Tick, and not at some other time on an arbitrary thread.\n\n\nThat said.. I\u0027m not sure these callbacks are getting called at the right time. It looks like we create and track CreatePipelineAsyncTaskResultBase when the async task is started - shouldn\u0027t it happen instead when the async task finishes?",
