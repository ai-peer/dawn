      "message": "The problem I was hoping to solve was removing the need to explicitly add `raw_hash_set` in the call to `bundle_libraries` in `tools/android/webgpu/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`. Part of the solution was using namespaced targets.\n\nUpon seeing your comment, I wanted to look deeper into why this was really necessary. Turns out it is unnecessary and the code in `bundle_libraries` should also iterate over the `INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES` (in addition to `LINK_LIBRARIES` as currently done).\n\n`flat_hash_set` and `flat_hash_map` are both header only and don\u0027t have `raw_hash_set` in their `LINK_LIBRARIES`. Instead, it exists in the `INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`. Learned this by debugging how `absl_cc_library` created libraries.\n\nSo, I propose abandoning this CL and creating a new one which patches `tools/android/webgpu/src/main/cpp/BundleLibraries.cpp` to do the right thing.",
