      "message": "Dug a bit deeper and found the root cause was because Device holds a Ref to Queue (which is an Object). That meant that Device was destroyed before Queue, leading to the weird behavior I was seeing. Added an explicit \"release\" of the queue in the Device dtor so that the ordering is fixed.",

      "message": "I talked about this with Loko and suggested the explicit release, but I think there\u0027s still going to be a problem in the future.\n\nIt was bad because the queue was outliving the device because of the internal reference.\n\nWe need to eventually get to a place where it\u0027s possible for the queue (or any object) to outlive the device (though it may be internally destroyed) if there are *external* references.\nSo if we lose the last reference to the device before losing the last external reference to the queue, we will still get into a situation where DestroyApiObject is called when the device has been destructed. So - we probably do want to keep the IsAlive check?\n\nit\u0027s still racy though: consider ~Ref\u003cQueueBase\u003e races ~Ref\u003cDeviceBase\u003e\n 1. ~Ref\u003cQueueBase\u003e -\u003e DeleteThis -\u003e DestroyApiObject passes the IsAlive check\n 2. ~Ref\u003cDeviceBase\u003e -\u003e ~DeviceBase -\u003e Destroy removes all items from linked lists\n 3. ~DeviceBase finishes\n 4. ~Ref\u003cQueueBase\u003e -\u003e DeleteThis -\u003e DestroyApiObject calls GetDevice() which is now garbage",
