I spent a bunch of time trying to make all these `int` to clearly indicate what is directly tied to the `f64` and what wasn\u0027t, and then you\u0027re in a world of implicit casts.\nI realised quickly that I was going to subtly break something, so I just opted to make everything 64-bit. Probably no slower on 64-bit architectures, and a tiny cost for 32 bit architectures. meh.",
