      "message": "Thanks Colin for adding the externalFormat! I was just adding TextureFormat::External and somehow ended up reaching this TODO [yesterday](https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/187361?checksPatchset\u003d10\u0026tab\u003dchecks) but not hitting this validation yet as my test does not create video but just AHB. Can this validation be removed/relaxed as for video from chrome the vkFormat can be undefined?",

      "message": "I think that it would be cleaner to add this to `properties` and pass it through in the above call, but I\u0027m not yet experienced enough in playing with the chained structs to determine how to create/chain the SharedTextureMemoryVkProperties such that it will end up with the lifetime of `SharedTextureMemory::mProperties` as needed rather than dangling when it falls out of scope here. Do you have feedback on that front?",
