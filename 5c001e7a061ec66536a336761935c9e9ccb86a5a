      "message": "I think that it would be cleaner to add this to `properties` and pass it through in the above call, but I\u0027m not yet experienced enough in playing with the chained structs to determine how to create/chain the SharedTextureMemoryVkProperties such that it will end up with the lifetime of `SharedTextureMemory::mProperties` as needed rather than dangling when it falls out of scope here. Do you have feedback on that front?",
