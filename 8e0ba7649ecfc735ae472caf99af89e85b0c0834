      "message": "Thanks for the CL! I don\u0027t if it is meant to be up for review yet. If it is the case you can add a couple OWNERS as reviewers and start the review. See https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/+/refs/heads/main/CONTRIBUTING.md for the contributing process which is a tiny bit different from Chromium (you need CR+2 to submit to CQ)\n\nThe fix looks good. We can also have a test specifically for this in third_party/dawn/src/dawn/tests/unittests/wire/WireBufferMappingTests.cpp if you want, or you can let the Dawn team take care of that if it\u0027s too involved.",
