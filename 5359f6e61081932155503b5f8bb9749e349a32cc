      "message": "All the backends have the same logic, instead we could have DeviceBase::HandleError check for device loss, call a LoseImpl method when that happens. Then TickImpl of various backends can check for device loss and return DAWN_DEVICE_LOST_ERROR in that case.\n\nWe\u0027ll also want a \"lose device extension\" for testing, so we could have device.Lose that calls LoseImpl.\n\nFinally in every single entrypoints (except maybe command recording outside of Finish / EndPass) we should DAWN_TRY(GetDevice()-\u003eValidateAlive()).",
