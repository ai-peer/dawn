Is there a reason the queue could not enqueue them into DeviceBase\u0027s mCallbackTaskManager instead?",

      "message": "Those queue\u0027s methods call Device::Tick() internally. In case of those CopyTexture* functions, they invoke Queue::APISubmit() internally which indirectly calls Device::Tick().\n\nUnless we want different semantic meaning between Device::APITick() and Device::Tick() such as Device::Tick() won\u0027t ever trigger pending callbacks?\n\nOr maybe the original intention for those Submit()/CopyTexture* methods is only using Tick() to update serial and not for triggering callbacks?",
