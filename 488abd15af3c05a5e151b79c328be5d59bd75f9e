      "message": "Will we have a future where ApiObject derived classes never implement the destructor and instead just implement DestroyImpl()?\n\nIf we did backend changes in the same CLs, then I think we could already start implementing Destroy() this way.\n\nThe slight complication with making ~ApiObjectBase call Destroy() is that for objects like buffers it is both the refcount and APIDestroy() that can end up in a call to Destroy(). Maybe ApiObjectBase::Destroy() could check whether we have been removed from the list before calling DestroyImpl() (it would require an additional boolean returned from RemoveFromList).",

      "message": "Is this why we have the fake constructors, so that we don\u0027t need to pass a valid constructor? Passing valid descriptors seem like a small additional thing to do but avoids turning off validation at adding FooBase(DeviceBase*) constructors just for testing. IMHO we should make the code paths in the mocks close to real backends if we can, which means passing descriptors around.",
