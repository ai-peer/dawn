      "message": "A working render of the cpphelloworld sample and a personal project that uses compute + some rendering. I ran into a couple of problems which I\u0027m not sure if they\u0027re bad code on my part, or issues with Dawn. I think running the tests on the phone would probably be a good start.\n\nRight now I\u0027m using a CMakeFile.txt with an empty activity, and basically no further tinkering on the Android side (basic example here: https://github.com/AlexVestin/dawn-android-example). \n\nIs there any example of setting up Dawn + gn with android studio / do you know if there\u0027d be any issue with that? From a quick glance the tests weren\u0027t set up with the cmake build, and adding support for that doesn\u0027t sound that fun ",
