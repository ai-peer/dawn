      "message": "sorry didn\u0027t notice the first time I reviewed.\n\nI\u0027m worried that this will result in some log spam.\n\nWe should probably have some LogOnce facility that avoids sending a message more than once (see EmitDeprecationWarning) as an example.\n\nif this becomes too much space in the hash map, we can improve it by deduping based on the message template \"Calling %s.DispatchWorkgroups with a ...\" instead of the full string. That way you get just one of that type of message.\n\nAnd, if that\u0027s still too much space in the hash map, we could have a mapping of enum -\u003e message template and set the enum\u0027s position in a bitset to indicate we logged already.",
