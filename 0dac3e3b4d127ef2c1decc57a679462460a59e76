I have a slight preference to reevaluating the condition each tick than setting up edge based logic, as the latter has a much higher tendency of being buggy.\n\nAlso, I believe there was an intention for Tick() to return a boolean to indicate whether device is idle or not - if this were to this, then I think this approach is probably nicer.\n\nEither way, this is negligible in terms of performance.",
