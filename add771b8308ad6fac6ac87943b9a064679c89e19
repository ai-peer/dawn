      "message": "Probably dumb question (and not new to this patch), but if I\u0027m reading WireClient.h correctly, initialDataInfo is supposed to receive structured data (a pointer, and a size). Is there a reason it can\u0027t be typed to that struct and passed as such higher up? Is it because it\u0027s supposed to be a fixed size on the wire and not dependent on C struct layout or something?",
