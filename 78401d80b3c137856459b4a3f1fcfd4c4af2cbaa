      "message": "I wonder if we should invert this CL: by default in release Dawn wouldn\u0027t set labels in backends because there\u0027s a performance cost. Graphite would benefit from this, but also any user of WebGPU in JS or Dawn in native.\n\nThen we can guide developers to set \"forward_labels_in_backend\" or something like that when they need to debug. We already have a bunch of toggles that can be used for debugging and that would just add to the list.",

      "message": "That\u0027s definitely how I would do it if starting from scratch - I did it this way to be non-intrusive to any existing clients of Dawn relying on this functionality. If you think it\u0027s fine to introduce this as a breaking change, I think it makes sense to do it the way that you outlined. WDYT?",
