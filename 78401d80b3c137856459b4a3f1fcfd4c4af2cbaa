Graphite would benefit from this, but also any user of WebGPU in JS or Dawn in native.\n\nThen we can guide developers to set \"forward_labels_in_backend\" or something like that when they need to debug. We already have a bunch of toggles that can be used for debugging and that would just add to the list.",
