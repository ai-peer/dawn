Turns out you can\u0027t clear to UINT32_MAX using ClearRenderTarget. I\u0027ve opened a bug to add a workaround for this: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/dawn/issues/detail?id\u003d528.\n\nTo retract my previous statement - I don\u0027t think there are any values that will trigger undefined behavior (that can\u0027t be worked around at least)\n\n",
