      "message": "Hmm I think I still agree with the decision in https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/86581 comment#21 and comment#78 to keep the blob in the backend one (if necessary, or just temporal). Mainly because in the future, these blobs may be monolithic caches that changes between accesses, i.e. two different serializeToBlob calls may return different things.\n\nIf we have them write to the internal member we would potentially have to deal with race cases, but if we just return a cachedblob then I think it would be easier to handle. WDYT?",

      "message": "here, I meant I think we should just directly do:\n\n```\nCachedBlob blob \u003d GetDevice()-\u003eGetBlobCache()-\u003eLoad(mCacheKey);\nif (!blob.Empty()) {\n  // set pCachedBlob\n}\n\n// create pipeline\n\nif (blob.Empty()) {\n  GetCachedBlob(...);\n  // store\n  GetDevice()-\u003eGetBlobCache()-\u003eStore(...);\n}\n```\n\nit is just as concise as the existing code and more clear what\u0027s happening. I don\u0027t think the PipelineCache abstraction is helping us here because the shape of the D3D12 API directly uses blobs.\n\nThen, we wouldn\u0027t need `cache-\u003eSetBlob` either which resolves Loko\u0027s concern.\n\nThe only thing you\u0027ll need to worry about is that GetBlobCache() may return null (so we should have a check for that, or hide it behind Load/Store that noop).",
