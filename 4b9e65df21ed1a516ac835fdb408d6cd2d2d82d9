If it turns out we never execute the recordingContext-\u003ecommandBuffer because of an error, it better be a DEVICE_LOST error so everything stops immediately.\n\nSome initial thoughts:\n\n1) We could try to \"undo\" marking resources as initialized, and any other assumptions based on successful command buffer execution\n2) We could store pending side-effects-to-apply on the CommandRecordingContext and then apply them on successful submission.\n3) We could make sure all errors are fatal. (This is currently true)\n\nWhat do you think?",
