      "message": "PTAL! Main focus of this change in the GPUInfo generation, but since adding the vendor/architecture to AdapterProperties was pretty trivial I\u0027ve thrown that in here too. I think we may want to eventually refactor those out into something that more closely matches the web-facing GPUAdapterInfo, but for now this will give us the data that we need on the Blink side using an existing mechanism.",

      "message": "I know this doesn\u0027t need to be futureproof yet, but at some point I can imagine we might end up needing different device masks for different ranges of ids. I wonder if it might make sense to just build the masks into the values, like \"660?\", \"661?\", etc.? Unfortunately it makes the code generation for GetArchitecture harder.",
