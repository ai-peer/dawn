And a lot of the intermediate changes would require decent amount of work to get the tests passing just so I could remove it all in favor of the new code path in the follow up.\n\nLMK if its too confusing and we can chat about it if necessary.",

Leaving as is unless you have another suggestion?\n\n(Note that I am moving the `unique_ptrs` instead so the semantic still implies that it\u0027s 1 time use?)",
