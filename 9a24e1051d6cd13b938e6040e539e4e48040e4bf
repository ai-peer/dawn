      "message": "Sorry for the delay! It\u0027s true that right now these are always safe given that they are only used on submit which is why I got a bit confused. I chatted with Austin though, and I think that while these allocators don\u0027t need the lock right now, in a multi-queue implementation they will (assuming that they continue to live on the device and not on the queue).\n\nMaking them safe with the lock also makes it a lot easier to reason about what should and shouldn\u0027t be protected as a whole. Otherwise we would need to specifically document each member and somehow audit their usage stack.",
