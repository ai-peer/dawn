I think I was fully misleading by the test here https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/angle/src/tests/egl_tests/EGLIOSurfaceClientBufferTest.cpp;l\u003d81?q\u003dIOSurfaceCreate\u0026ss\u003dchromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc\n\nNow I ref to the codes here (https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ui/gfx/mac/io_surface.cc;l\u003d228?q\u003dIOSurfaceCreate\u0026ss\u003dchromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc) and the test passed.\n\nThanks for your helps!",
