(for example doing directory by directory or something else).\n\nAlso for sweeping changes like that, I\u0027d like to review by having instructions on how to reproduce the mechanical part of the change so it\u0027s easy to see the manual part of the changes.",

      "message": "The manual part is in Patchset 1. The other patchsets are from me running `./tools/format` on Patchset 1. (I just revert the format change, rerun format and upload again so I don\u0027t have to resolve conflicts).\n\nAs to landing, I can do it either way, I thought this might be less disruptive. I can also send out a PSA and plan to land it next weekend if that would make things easier? If we wanted to d the dir-by-dir route I\u0027ll have to add `.clang-format` files to each dir as I go and then delete them at the end.",
