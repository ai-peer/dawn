      "message": "Hm, I think these result in slightly ugly C enums (VERTEX_FORMAT_U_CHAR2_NORM) etc. It\u0027s fine to leave as is, but maybe there\u0027s a way to avoid it.\n\n(would \"name\": \"uChar2 norm\" be too hacky? I think it would give VertexFormat::UChar2Norm and VERTEX_FORMAT_UCHAR2_NORM but I\u0027m not sure. Or \"uChar2Norm\" if you want VERTEX_FORMAT_UCHAR2NORM which matches sketch.webidl more closely.)",
