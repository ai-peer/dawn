We use these hash maps for object deduplication. Getting the wrong object and wrong rendering is very, very bad.

Aside from remembering the recorded key, the CL looks like it does the same thing as the original hashing but factors it into a different class. I think one of the goals of doing this was to also reduce the code duplication from traversing objects to do equality comparison and traversing objects to do hashing.\n\nOr, will CompareVisitor be in a different CL?\n\nAnd I *think* we\u0027re still going to have some serialization? for caching shader blobs I thought?\n\nSorry, overall I\u0027m just a bit unclear on what the decided upon direction is going to be.",

      "message": "Sure - the simple plan only requires we get the pipeline hash for the \"PSO name\" so we can lookup/store d3d pipelines _directly_ in a pipeline library. The pipeline library already knows how to serialize itself and the persistent key to a pipeline library is built from device properties.\n\nFor persistently storing shaders, the persistent key is built from the input shader source and the shader blob is the compiled DX bytecode.\n\nIn either case, there is no need to additionally serialize or traverse (hence being simple) where the only code duplication introduced comes from the need to re-hash for the d3d pipeline library like the object cache already does.

      "message": "In discussion over chat, we discussed that FingerprintRecorder right now is mostly a hashing optimization, and it would be nice if it could also be extended to eliminate the duplicate traversal for hashing and equality. The duplication is dangerous because its prone to error in not keeping them in sync or if it misses some members - and that would be a big security problem. If the FingerprintRecorder only does hashing, it factors code and adds additional complexity to do something that\u0027s already *mostly* possible today. It should also deduplicate the traversal to improve maintainability of the code.\n\nLet\u0027s keep this CL around as a nice-to-have if extended with the CompareVisitor to deduplicate the traversals. Bryan, you can add that if you\u0027re interested.\n\nBut this hashing refactor isn\u0027t in the critical path to implement the pipeline caching feature, so let\u0027s focus on the caching part first / in parallel.\n\nNot particularly concerned about triple-hashing right now (once for blueprint, once for creation, and once for the pipeline key), but if it becomes a problem, we can always add a simple way for key-reuse if the FingerprintRecorder doesn\u0027t land first. This would just involve passing the key from the blueprint through to creation of the actual pipeline. It doesn\u0027t reuse child object hashes, but good enough for now.\n\ntldr; my suggestion is to implement the caching interface, even if it has triple hashing, and this CL is orthogonal.",
