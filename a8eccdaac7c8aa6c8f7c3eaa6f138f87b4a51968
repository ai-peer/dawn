It lets you pass in a struct which implements the visitor functionality so it can be customized for different types of traversals.\n\nThere\u0027s a few downsides to the current approach:\n - the equality function now walks the entire object tree - this is suboptimal if it can return early\n - the equality function is now effectively comparing hashes - which means our equality check is wrong if there are hash collisions\n - I don\u0027t immediately see how this is extendable to serialization",
