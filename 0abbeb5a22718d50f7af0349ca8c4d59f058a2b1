(ignore later patchsets, I was doing other stuff). Why did this happen?\n\nBecause we strip release-x64 and there\u0027s no analogous release-x86, we have no way to identify failures only on the x86 bot. So the x86 bot saw all timeouts, but the roller exonerated all of them and used a pass because the x64 bot passed :(\n\nso looks like I need to fix this x86/x64 ambiguity first..",
