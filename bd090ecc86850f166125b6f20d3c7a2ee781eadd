The specific issues called out in the bug end up with:\n\n```\nout/o.wgsl:2:13 error: function call \u0027inf\u0027 seen for the first time\n    let c \u003d inf(1);\n            ^^^\n```\n\nwhich I think is better, but could maybe use more work.\n\n```\nout/o.wgsl:3:13 error: cannot use \u0027min\u0027 (a let) as a function call\n    let b \u003d min(1, 2);\n            ^^^\n\nout/o.wgsl:2:9 note: let \u0027min\u0027 declared here\n    let min \u003d 1;\n        ^^^\n```\n\nwhich I do think is better.",
