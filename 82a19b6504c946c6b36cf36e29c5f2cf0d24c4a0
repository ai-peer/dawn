      "message": "It turns out that at least one failed CTS (`gwebgpu:api,operation,vertex_state,correctness:discontiguous_location_and_attribs:`, code [here](https://github.com/gpuweb/cts/blob/main/src/webgpu/api/operation/vertex_state/correctness.spec.ts#L1049) and [here](https://github.com/gpuweb/cts/blob/main/src/webgpu/api/operation/vertex_state/correctness.spec.ts#L229)) use discontinuous buffer slot in `GPUBufferState.buffers` (which is a `sequence\u003cGPUVertexBufferLayout?\u003e`), leaving some elements in the `buffers` being `undefined`. \nI am not very sure how these unused and `undefined` elements are treated in Dawn, but it is possible to be represented as a normal `VertexBufferLayout` with all field default-initialized, i.e. `attributeCount \u003d\u003d 0` and `stepMode \u003d\u003d vertex`. If I get it right, the removed `if` statement filter away these unused buffer by checking `attributeCount \u003d\u003d 0`, together with used buffer with zero attribute. Removing the `if` statement in RenderPipeline.cpp may resulting in all those unused slots before the last used slot be misrecognized as used buffer with zero attribute.\nI am not very sure about how to distinguish between these unused buffer slots (before the last used slot) and used slot with zero attribute yet.",

Need of setting buffers to unused slots sounds weird. Thanks for opening the issue and PR there [4].\n\nSo, should we wait for the spec update?\n\n[1]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/_/dawn/dawn.git/+/680f513bda0bdb3e843d68f2b0b6a348c2fb83c7:src/dawn/native/RenderPipeline.cpp;l\u003d505-511;drc\u003dd181a3cf55dbf76a0f9dbd780b6cc578354dfed3;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d0\n[2]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/_/dawn/dawn.git/+/680f513bda0bdb3e843d68f2b0b6a348c2fb83c7:src/dawn/native/RenderPipeline.cpp;l\u003d672-676;drc\u003dd181a3cf55dbf76a0f9dbd780b6cc578354dfed3;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d0\n[3]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/_/dawn/dawn.git/+/680f513bda0bdb3e843d68f2b0b6a348c2fb83c7:src/dawn/native/CommandBufferStateTracker.cpp;l\u003d225-233;drc\u003d41e4d9a34c1d9dcb2eef3ff39ff9c1f987bfa02a;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d0\n[4]: https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2844",

      "message": "I think Dawn already implements the fix in https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2843 so we might not need this part of the change? Or did you find that the test was failing without it?\n\nAh! It is because in Dawn\u0027s webgpu.h we currently don\u0027t have a way to know whether a slot is used or not. Previously \"attributeCount \u003d\u003d 0\" meant that it was unused but that\u0027s no longer the case. We could repurpose stepMode for that by adding an \"undefined\" enum value to it in dawn.json, but that\u0027s a bit ugly.\n\nThis would be a three-sided patch (otherwise we risk breaking Chrome by using an uninitialized value):\n - Add the \"undefined\" enum value with 0 in dawn.json (and make it the default value in the wgpu::VertexBufferDescriptor)\n - Set the value undefined for all buffers in https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/modules/webgpu/gpu_render_pipeline.cc;l\u003d196;bpv\u003d0;bpt\u003d1\n - Use undefined to continue the loop before setting mVertexBufferSlotsUsed.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s worth changing the spec to only validate if there is at least one attribute. The current behavior has been there since the text was introduced in https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/1866/files\n\nWe should raise an issue to the group to see if they would be amenable to relaxing the validation, but can start doing the implementation using stepMode::undefined in parallel, as you wish.\n\nIt seems that every \"starter\" issue I suggest both in Chromium and Dawn are much more complicated than they seem.",
