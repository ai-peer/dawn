If I get it right, the removed `if` statement filter away these unused buffer by checking `attributeCount \u003d\u003d 0`, together with used buffer with zero attribute. Removing the `if` statement in RenderPipeline.cpp may resulting in all those unused slots before the last used slot be misrecognized as used buffer with zero attribute.\nI am not very sure about how to distinguish between these unused buffer slots (before the last used slot) and used slot with zero attribute yet.",

We need a way to know used slots with the descriptor in the native.

Need of setting buffers to unused slots sounds weird. Thanks for opening the issue and PR there [4].\n\nSo, should we wait for the spec update?\n\n[1]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/_/dawn/dawn.git/+/680f513bda0bdb3e843d68f2b0b6a348c2fb83c7:src/dawn/native/RenderPipeline.cpp;l\u003d505-511;drc\u003dd181a3cf55dbf76a0f9dbd780b6cc578354dfed3;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d0\n[2]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/_/dawn/dawn.git/+/680f513bda0bdb3e843d68f2b0b6a348c2fb83c7:src/dawn/native/RenderPipeline.cpp;l\u003d672-676;drc\u003dd181a3cf55dbf76a0f9dbd780b6cc578354dfed3;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d0\n[3]: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/_/dawn/dawn.git/+/680f513bda0bdb3e843d68f2b0b6a348c2fb83c7:src/dawn/native/CommandBufferStateTracker.cpp;l\u003d225-233;drc\u003d41e4d9a34c1d9dcb2eef3ff39ff9c1f987bfa02a;bpv\u003d1;bpt\u003d0\n[4]: https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/pull/2844",
