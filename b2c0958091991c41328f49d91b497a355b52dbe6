      "message": "\u003e this copies existing RetryOnFailure status into the new result tree?\n\nCorrect.\n\n\u003e should we avoid changing the status if the new tree sees it as [ Failure ] ? I suppose that could have a problem where RetryOnFailure gets upgraded to Failure, and then only partially downgraded back to RetryOnFailure - which doesn\u0027t preserve the expectations as we intended\n\nYeah exactly. This reduces flapping, which is what I think infra wants.\n\n\u003e what is the difference between doing this, versus having RetryOnFailure imply `keep` in `func (u *updater) expectation(in Expectation, keep bool)`?\n\nFaking the results means that it can glob higher than the existing `RetryOnFailure` expectations. This might be important to keep the ever-growing list under control.",
