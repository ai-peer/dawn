      "message": "to clarify:\n\nthis copies existing RetryOnFailure status into the new result tree?\n\nshould we avoid changing the status if the new tree sees it as [ Failure ] ? I suppose that could have a problem where RetryOnFailure gets upgraded to Failure, and then only partially downgraded back to RetryOnFailure - which doesn\u0027t preserve the expectations as we intended\n\n\nwhat is the difference between doing this, versus having RetryOnFailure imply `keep` in `func (u *updater) expectation(in Expectation, keep bool)`?",
