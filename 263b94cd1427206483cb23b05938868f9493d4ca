      "message": "So it looks like you\u0027ve manually globbed all the parameterized cases under the tests queries. We _can_ do this, but I\u0027ve had push back on this before, because it\u0027s over generalizing. As this is not in a `KEEP` block, the roller will glob all ancestors up the tree automatically, [assuming the majority of the parmeterized cases fail](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/+/refs/heads/main/tools/src/cts/expectations/update.go#737) - however the majority doesn\u0027t fail - only `srgb` and `display-p3`.\n\nThe WebGPU CTS query syntax understands parameterized cases, so the CTS runner can glob with as many or as few named parameters as you like - however the `typ` (the python expectation system) doesn\u0027t - it sees all expectations as a string. With `typ` you have the ability to use a `*`, but it **must** come at the very end of the stringified query name. For these, the color space is at the end of the string, so `*` is not useful.",
