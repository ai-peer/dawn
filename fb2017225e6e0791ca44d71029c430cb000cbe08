      "message": "Partly because I was cargo-culting the coding style for other scoped object types in Dawn and the one I looked at was Mutex::AutoLock.\n\nHowever, I do think NonMovable is a better choice than moveable since we don\u0027t want this to be passed around and have a longer lifetime than the calling function\u0027s scope - similar to AutoLock (although std::unique_ptr does allow you to get around that).\n\nStruct vs class is a minor stylistic choice - again lifted that from Mutex::AutoLock.\n\nThat being said, I\u0027m open to making it moveable if needed.",
