I see enums so what I\u0027d expect is some class I can call that will return a vector of enums from an vector of strings (or code gen with bools for each enum) and then I\u0027d use enums everywhere in the code and never error prone strings that I might end up with a typo. But, I most code I see is using strings, not enums.\n\nShould I be doing something else?",
