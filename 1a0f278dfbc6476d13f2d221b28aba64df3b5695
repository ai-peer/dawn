      "message": "I added two more tests to cover whether bindings in pipeline (used in shaders) match bindings in bind group in current render/compute pass. I followed the similar rule: extra bind group, and extra entry in a bind group. However, if we have extra entry in bind group, it will fail now. I suppose it is incorrect. So I added a TODO here. please correct me if it is not what you supposed to.",
