In a sense they are closer to https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/dawn/src/tests/unittests/validation/RenderPassValidationTests.cpp\n\nWhat matters for the validation in the passes is that the bindgroup\u0027s layout and the pipeline\u0027s bindGroupLayouts match. That part of the validation doesn\u0027t know anything about the specific bindings, so that it can be very small and fast. See the implementation of it here: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/dawn/src/dawn_native/CommandBufferStateTracker.cpp?sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d90",

      "message": "I added two more tests to cover whether bindings in pipeline (used in shaders) match bindings in bind group in current render/compute pass. I followed the similar rule: extra bind group, and extra entry in a bind group. However, if we have extra entry in bind group, it will fail now. I suppose it is incorrect. So I added a TODO here. please correct me if it is not what you supposed to.",
