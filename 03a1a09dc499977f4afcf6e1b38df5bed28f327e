      "message": "There is an issue when installing tint and disabling building benchmarks because the target tint_cmd_bench inside src/tint/cmd/bench/BUILD.cmake should be of the kind bench but, I could not figure it out how to regenerate that file with that value. \n\nConcretely, when we disable `TINT_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` the other targets that depend on tint_cmd_bench are not built and cmake optimizes and doesnt generate a library. I tried locally to manually change the file and it works for both enabled and disabled",
