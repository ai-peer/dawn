      "message": "Abseil, as pulled in from Chromium, assumes that the googletest directory is laid out differently than what Dawn was already using. This snippet is pulled directly from ANGLE, and switches over to use the variant of googletest that\u0027s used by the Chromium repo. It looks like it\u0027ll take a bit more effort to roll (and this may represent a roll back to an earlier version than we were previously on) but I didn\u0027t notice any problems once I adjusted the directory location in the relvant .gn files.",
