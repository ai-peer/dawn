      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how to deal with these tests. They are testing CreateComputePipelineAsyncTask behavior but they are deleted. \n\nI tried to keep them as is and created the new `CreateComputePipelineAsyncEvent`, but seems we don\u0027t have mockEventManager etc. I did a quick try using the event manager from native instance to TrackEvent. but the test reporting mock leak (The event manager from native instance stays). So I didn\u0027t put that code here but simply remove these tests. Would like to hear your thoughts on this and update tomorrow",

      "message": "I think it should be possible to have similar tests by calling `Device.APICreateComputePipelineAsync(F)` and injecting the `ComputePipelineMock` via an expectation on `Device::CreateUninitializedComputePipelineImpl`. Then with the same expectation on `InitializeImpl`, I think waiting on the respective future, or ticking the device should test the effective same code path.",
