See this diff https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3362856/2/build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn which I think will make this work in chromium, where we\u0027re guaranteed to statically link our hermetic, up-to-date libc++abi. (This might not help dawn, which might not do this, I don\u0027t know.)",
