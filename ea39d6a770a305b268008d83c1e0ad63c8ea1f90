      "message": "Ideally, I think we should try to avoid mutating the IR in the printer. Mutation should occur during `raise`. If the writer does fail, and we need to print the IR disassembly, the mutations are going to make things confusing.\n\nIn all the places we use `ConstantValue()`, we immediately pass that to `Constant()`. We could just as easily have the printer map `tint::Number`s to SPIR-V IDs, and avoid the need to mutate the IR.",
