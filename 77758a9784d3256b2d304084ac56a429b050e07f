      "message": "This test indeed crashed before the production revisions when I added a `DAWN_ASSERT(staticSampler-\u003esampler)` to the validation code that I had in `ValidateSamplerBinding()`. Nonetheless, it seems a little clunky. If you have any more elegant suggestions, I\u0027m definitely up for it. I guess the real issue is that this is more of an end2end test in nature, but I can\u0027t do that yet because I\u0027m not yet actually using static samplers.",
