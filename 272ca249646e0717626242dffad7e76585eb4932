      "message": "`std::bitset`, `boost::dynamic_bitset`, and `std::vector\u003cbool\u003e` all return a reference object that allows reading and writing to the specific bit via the object. This is a pretty common pattern, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that confusing. I see that Ben renamed `marked` to `marked_bit_ref`, which helps, though I think even just `marked_bit` would have been fine.",
