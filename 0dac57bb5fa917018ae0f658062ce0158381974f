      "message": "Agreed. It\u0027s not immediately obvious that the `Symbol name` is expected to the same namespace (`ProgramID`) as the ir module\u0027s `ProgramID`.\n\nPassing in a `Symbol` also gives the suggestion that it is **the symbol** that will be used (i.e. no collision renaming), but this isn\u0027t necessarily true.\n\nI\u0027d recommend either actually using the symbol as-is, or changing this method to take a `std::string_view`",
