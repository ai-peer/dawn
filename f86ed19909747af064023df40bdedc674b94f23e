I thought we still had that, because we\u0027d have seen the same bug with passing the limit through? But looks removed in https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/122801\n\nIn any case I\u0027m pretty sure we need that again, because otherwise we\u0027ll end up blocklisting tons of Intel/AMD/NVIDIA devices.\n\nAlso add ImgTec to the list because they\u0027ve told us they have the same bug.",
