      "message": "This logic depends on the comment above as well (\"since both of them are powers of two...\"). I don\u0027t think that will ever change but I think it needs an explicit callout that this line assumes offsetAlignment is already a power of 2. (If it weren\u0027t this could cause offsetAlignment to be unaligned with optimalOffsetAlignment or byteSize.)\n\nAlso, since it\u0027s already assuming that, offsetAlignment \u003d std::max(offsetAlignment, 4u) should work equally well and is more consistent with line 99.",

      "message": "Can we have some commments that explain how this tests the issue? Right now I don\u0027t see why it would reproduce the problem: it\u0027s not that the source offset isn\u0027t aligned, the issue is that the DynamicUploader gives back an unaligned pointer. So I think we just need to do 2 writeTextures, one an R8Unorm of a single pixel that will unalign the DynamicUploader, then one into a stencil aspect that would have used the unaligned dynamic uploader.",
