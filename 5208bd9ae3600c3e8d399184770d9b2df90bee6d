      "message": "D3D11 have 3 kinds of buffer\u0027s usage:\n- Default: GPU read and GPU write only, CPU no access.\n- Dynamic: CPU write and GPU read only.\n- Staging: CPU read and write. GPU read and write are only allowed in Copy operations.\n\nSo you cannot have a general purposes buffers that can be read \u0026 write mappable and be used as index, uniform, storage buffers etc. Even if the GPU is UMA.\n\nWe need two classes of feature anw because the general purposes feature is still useful for some one need it (i.e. writing a buffer in compute and then map for readback, that\u0027s not possible with D3D11, even though on UMA systems it should be possible. There is no D3D usage that allows GPU write and CPU write at the same time).\n\nOr another example use case:\n- a buffer that is both CPU writable and GPU writable. Let say a vertex buffer that is partially filled on CPU via mapping and then later filled in compute.\n\nSuch use case is not possible with D3D11\u0027s limitations either.",

I\u0027m thinking it might be wise to rewrite Buffer as multiple subclasses of Buffer which override methods accordingly.
