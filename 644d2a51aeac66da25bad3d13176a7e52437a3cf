      "message": "Hmm, the unused bindings for inappropriate shader stage (for example, bindings are for compute stage, but they are used in a render pass) are different from what you are saying here. But your comments remind me that the unused bindings can happen in another situation: bindings are set and bound in bind group(s), but some of the bindings\u0027 layout are not included in pipeline layout of current pipeline. I added tests for this situation.",
