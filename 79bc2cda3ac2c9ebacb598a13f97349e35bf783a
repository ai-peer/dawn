I edited them in:\n\nhttps://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers/issues/45#issuecomment-1776319835\n\nWe had concluded there was no particular need to reserve undefined for output enums though I don\u0027t think there was any argument against it either.\n\nMaybe it is better to just reserve 0, it doesn\u0027t hurt anything and can be handy e.g. for \"uninitialized\" status variables.",
