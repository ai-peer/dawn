      "message": "Hi Yunchao, I am implementing copying multiple texture array layers in one copy call, so there can be multiple array layers that need barriers and may have conflict with your work here. (https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/c/dawn/+/22140)\n\nCould you help me change the layer here to \"copy-\u003ecopySize.depth\"? It is safe because even without my CL, copy-\u003ecopySize.depth should always be equal to 1 here.",
