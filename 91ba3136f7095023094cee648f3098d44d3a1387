      "message": "The main problem is that the arguments are wrong for option(). The build will fail on generating the cache. There is no CACHE or type argument for option(): https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/option.html.\n\nWhen using set() with CACHE, the variable is still customizable. My understanding is that option() and set() are essentially the same here, I just went with set() because that\u0027s what the rest of the code was using. I could replace it with option().",
