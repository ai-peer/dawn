      "message": "Hm, so I have mixed feelings about these helpers. We don\u0027t really have much use for them right now in Dawn since we don\u0027t have real \"chains\" yet (there can only be a single surface descriptor, a single shader module descriptor, etc). I\u0027m happy to polish up this CL and write some tests, but I wonder if we should just hold off until there\u0027s actually a use case for chains of length \u003e 1. The helpers don\u0027t really make any of the existing sType code blocks more readable.",
